|something with tools, how all the other men in the neighborhood are magnetically drawn to this activity. They just come wandering out of the house like zombies.|
|Men, it's true, men hear a drill, it's like a dog whistle. Just.. you know, they go running up to that living room curtain, "Honey, I think Jim's working on something over|
|there." So they run over to the guy. Now they don't actually help the guy. No, they just want to hang around the area where work is being done. That's what men|
|want to do. We want to watch the guy, we want to talk to him, we want to ask him dumb questions. You know, "What are you using, the Philips head?" You know,|
|we feel involved. That's why when they have construction sites, they have to have those wood panel fences around it, that's just to keep the men out. They cut those|
little holes for us so we can see what the hell is going on. But if they don't cut those holes - we are climbing those fences. Right over there. "What are you using the
|steel girders down there? Yeah, that'll hold."|
|my next-door neighbor. Uh.. nothing much.. Tuesday? Uh, Tuesday, no. I'm meeting somebody.. Uh, Wednesday? Wednesday's okay.. Alright. Uh, I'm a little busy|
|right now. Can we talk Wednesday morning? .. Okay.. yeah.. right.. thanks.. bye. (hangs up, then addresses Kramer) Why did you put me on the phone with him? I|
hate just being handed a phone.
my life because I like to play Ping Pong? I was ten. I would've been friends with Stalin if he had a Ping Pong table.. he's so self-involved.
|you know what I mean? There's nothing I can do. I have to wait for someone to die. I think that's the only way out of this relationship. It could be a long time. See,|
the great thing about guys is that we can become friends based on almost nothing. Just two guys will just become friends just because they're two guys. That's almost
all we need to have in common. 'Cause sports - sports and women - is really all we talk about. If there was no sports and no women the only thing guys would ever
|say is "So, what's in the refrigerator?"|
|it when there's nobody on the line at all, you know that part, you go to the bank, it's empty and you still have to go through the little maze. "Can you get a little piece|
of cheese for me? I'm almost at the front. I'd like a reward for this please."

|nephew - Yeah, he's got an exam tomarrow.. geometry.. you know, trapezoids, rhombus.. Anyway, listen, you take the tickets. They're at the Will-Call window..|
|And I'm really sorry.. Have a good time. We'll talk next week. Okay.. yeah, I don't.. fine.. fine.. bye. (he hangs up).|
|Tuesday - Lakers. I mean, you gotta like Magic, right? Let's see, on the road, on the road, on the road, on the road, back on the fourteenth. They play the Bulls.|
You can't miss Air Jordan..
|see them, you don't really want to see them. You don't call them. They call you. You don't call back. They call again. The only way to get through talking with people|
that you don't really have anything in common with is to pretend you're hosting your own little talk show. This is what I do. You pretend there's a little desk around
|you. The only problem with this is there's no way you can say, "Hey, it's been great having you on the show. Were out of time."|
Would you believe a big purple jeep?
|Okay, they don't hit anything, but Jerry's hand *did* get stuck...|
|Anyhoots, Elaine goes to roll down the window, and...|
the radio doesn't work... and it smells like a cheap hooker...
(pause) Or is that you?
|So, I told him if he picks us up at the airport, he wouldn't have|
to pay me anything.
|The driver speeds away without our heroes, and he seems pretty happy about it.|
|Finally inside, they check their luggage...|
Get your knees up!
|Yeah, but Jerry-- she's so darned perky when she runs. Besides, she's carrying luggage and you're not. Some gentleman. Hmfph. Anyway, they get to the ticket counter.|
sitting in my seat...
|Elaine moves over, and he moves in. The guy's got like 5 bags and Data General laptop.|
Did I mention that Tia is one hot tamale? Yikes.
|Anyway, we cut back to George and Kramer in the car.|
|I tell you, it's a thing of beauty. I can not express to you the feeling I get from a perfect airport pickup.|
|Um, George... Did you say "perfect"?|
I like to stop at the duty free shop!
|Meanwhile, back on the plane, Jerry and Tia are chatting (isn't that always the way? You get stuck beside someone who insists on going on and on about their kids and how their life didn't go according to plan and all that boring dreck...)|
that washcloth to cover yourself up...
|Um, what was that page number again?|
Kramer comes into the gift shop and does a Krameresque double-take at "that guy" from the departure screen who's browsing books. He goes up to
George.
|*up*!! I can't hold it anymore! (To the slug out loud) Excuse me, I've gotta go to the bathroom...|
|The cad has the nerve to look peeved, and Elaine has a hard time getting out of her seat. She looks a little like Kramer stumbling and falling into the aisle. The capper is that as she's getting up, facing the row of seats (and their staring sitters) across from her, Elaine makes faces at them like she's a homicidal maniac from "Taxi Driver". You can just see the words "You lookin' at *me*?" etched in her brain. It's a killer.|
|Anyway, as Elaine scurries off to the bathroom, Jerry and Tia are enjoying some hot towels on their faces.|
|he asks me to loan him his share of the rent-- 240 bucks! He took the cash and )pfffft( disappears. Well, I try to find him, I went|
|to his girlfriend's house, even his family. Uh-uh. I never got the money back! He screwed me! And that's the guy-- John Grossbard!|
We... we must go forward... not back.
|George, that's beautiful. Ever thought of running for office?|
|They do that "tink" thing again, and we rejoin Elaine going back to her seat, but the other attendant is serving the slop to the unwashed masses|
in coach and he's in her way.
Now please... You're just gonna have to wait.
|Back at JFK, George and Kramer check out the Arrivals board (again)...|
miles with every purchase... Wait! Get two tickets. As long as
your turning it in for a refund what's the difference? I'll get *double* the bonus miles.
|Back in *coach* (I get hives just thinking about it), Elaine returns to her|
seat now that the attendant is done serving.
|Take the food, Elaine. But ask that guy just what the heck a kosher meal is-- I'm curious...|
|Meanwhile, Jerry and Tia enjoy a nummy-lookin' dessert treat.|
Does that include Rabbi-slaughtered bovines?
Back at JFK...
|I dunno, George. Those *coach* bathrooms stink. Just ask Elaine.|
|Kramer goes forward and confronts Grossbard. For his part, Grossbard doesn't seem to recognise Kramer from twenty years ago (then again, he apparently had short hair at the time). After trying in vain to reach Grossbard's wallet, Kramer is escorted off the plane. Before this can take place, George knocks on the bathroom door to a reply of "Just a minute" from the occupant inside (I bet he stinks). Anyway, the door opens and, surprise! It's the Prisoner without his Time magazine (at least now we know why he needed it so badly-- reading material for the john). Anyway, the guy pulls George into the bathroom (he's still wearing his cuffs and shackles, BTW (that's got to make it rather difficult to go to the bathroom, but I digress)). So, while George is in the can with the serial killer, Kramer is escorted off the plane. Don't worry-- the plane isn't moving yet. And what's up with going to the bathroom on a non-moving plane? Isn't there laws against that? Or is it just trains that you have to wait until they're moving? Who really cares, anyway?|
No good. He breaks free and makes a run for it and seemingly escapes.
|Meanwhile, Jerry is getting ready for deboarding and he glances out the window only to see a rather harried Kramer running, arms flailing out on the runway. He takes a second look, just to be sure.|
|After they get off the plane, J+E look for the boys and get their baggage|
|how would they know Kramer was there, too? They didn't get a hold of George on the phone, or he would've went to Laguardia in the first|
place...)
|you stand there going "Bye!" So I was on this flight where the flight attendant-- it was her first day on the job so they didn't have a uniform for her yet, and that really... makes a big difference,|
|I mean this is just some regular person coming over to you going "Would you mind bringing your seat back all the way up?" It's like, "Who the Hell are you?!"|
Seems to me the way they design the car alarm is so that the car will behave as
|if it was a nervous hysterical person. Anyone goes near it, anyone disturbs it,|
|it's aaaaaahhhhhhh! Lights flashing on and off, acting all crazy. Not|
|everybody wants to draw that much attention to themselves, wouldn't it be nice|
|if you could have a car alarm that was a little more subtle? You know, somebody|
|tries to break in, it goes, "Ahem. Ahem. Excuse me?" I would like a car alarm|
like that.

It's fascinating. When you go into a stationery store that they're manufacturing millions of pens; constantly we're all buying them. I must have bought six thousand Bics in my life. I've used up maybe two of them. Where are the rest of them? When you move the refrigerator there's a couple back there but it doesn't account for it. Where are all the pens?
That's why it's so embarrassing if you don't have one. You got a pen? Can I borrow a pen? We always have to whisper because it's so humiliating. I don't have a pen. They're making millions of them every week! I know; where are they?

|vegetation and sees a farmhouse, its lights blazing. His face lights up. He|
|stumbles towards the welcoming lights, tripping and falling, before picking|
himself up and running up to the building.
Newman reaches the steps to the porch and stumbles up them. As he
|reaches the door, a scent catches his attention. Looking to the window, he sees a|
pie left out on the window sill to cool. A craftier look comes to his face. He
|turns back to the door and knocks. After a few seconds, it opens.|
I'm a US postal worker and my mail truck was just ambushed by a band of
backwoods mail-hating survivalists.
|This farm ain't much, but uh, you're welcome to what we have. Hot bath,|
|hearty meal, clean bed.|
|Just then, the daughter in question slinks up behind the farmer.|
|Blonde, twenty-ish, just one walking temptation.|
Kramer has the mail truck right behind Jerry's Saab as they race along
a quiet country road.
|running scared, buddy.|
|Jerry and Elaine are sitting on the couch, each with a phone handset.|
Kramer crouches as far as he can. Tony flings the object at Kramer's
mail truck. It crashes against the windshield and bounces away.
|Tony hurls another club at the mail truck. Again, it bounces off the|
|windshield, leaving some cracks.|
he's taking out the woods!
Tony flings a heavy wood at the truck.
|The Saab leads the truck down the road, with Tony hurling club after|
club over his shoulder and into the front of the truck.
Tony hurls the golf bag at the truck. It slams solidly against the
|windshield, Kramer flinches, the truck swerves. The front wheel runs over a club on|
the tarmac and the tyre bursts.
The Saab easily outpaces the truck and accelerates away. The truck
|staggers to a halt, giving out a death rattle. A cloud of steam and smoke erupts from|
under the hood.
Jerry hangs up.
Kramer climbs out of the truck and looks back down the road. He kicks
|the deflated tyre. Coming to the front of the truck, he picks a club off|
the front bumper and pulls the broken shaft of another out of the radiator
grille.
Kramer walks along the road with the bent and broken clubs. He comes
|upon the bag and transfers the clubs into it. Slinging it over his shoulder, he|
|continues on his way, picking up more battered golf clubs as he goes.|
|Newman, the farmer and the farmer's daughter sit round the kitchen|
table. They are working their way through a generous meal.
|sight. I would, I would love to get the recipe. It's very good.|
|The farmer's daughter is staring at Newman and toying with her fork,|
|touching it to her lips and teeth. (It's difficult to be arousing with cutlery, but|
she's giving it a pretty good shot.) Newman notices this and tries to take a
|nonchalant sip from a glass, but it goes down the wrong way and he|
splutters.
|benefit) I'm a big, strong, cider guy.|
The farmer's daughter licks her lips.
|Nautilus, of course. (puffs out his chest)|
The farmer looks at him oddly.
George is using a payphone in the corner of the room. His free hand is
holding the waistband of his trousers. In the background are a couple of
|inmates and visitors, and an orderly. Notable among them are Pop and Deena Lazzari,|
previously seen in 'The Gum'.
|to hold my pants up. (listens) Well, you gotta come over here now! Just tell 'em|
|what we talked about, how I, how I, I didn't do the project.|
Deena spots George as she makes her way out of the room.
|here. Listen, you gotta help me. You gotta tell these people that I'm okay.|
You know that I don't belong in here.
|As he tries to follow Deena, the orderly grabs hold of him and|
restrains him.
George is almost in tears and hops from foot to foot in frustration as
the orderly holds him. Pop Lazzari wanders over.
little car?
Kramer approaches a familiar farmhouse. As he mounts the steps up to
|the porch, a commotion erupts inside the place. A gunshot rings out and the|
farmer's daughter screams. Kramer flinches. The farmer can be heard yelling
angrily. The door is flung open and Newman runs out pulling up his trousers.
Newman sets off running. From the door of the farmhouse comes the
|farmer, armed with a shotgun, closely followed by his daughter, whose shirt is undone|
and hair is dishevelled.
|As Kramer and Newman reach the edge of the crops, the farmer fires a|
shot. Both Newman and Kramer leap in the air and run into the cover of the crop.
|Before the farmer can fire again, his daughter pushes the barrel of the shotgun|
|downward, spoiling his aim.|
Elaine is sitting with her head in her hands. Peterman enters at a rush.
|To me, going to the health club, you see all these people and they're|
|working out, and they're training and they're getting in shape but the|
strange thing is nobody is really getting in shape for anything. The only
reason that you're getting in shape is that so you can get through the
|workout. So we're working out, so that we'll be in shape, for when we have|
to do our exercise. This is the whole thing. The other thing I don't get
|about it, is why we're so careful about locking up our dirty towels and|
smelly jock-straps. What exactly is the black market on these disgusting gym
clothes? I give my car to any valet guy in front of a restaraunt because he
|has a short red jacket, yeah he must be the valet guy, I don't even think|

Kramer and Jerry smile in agreement.

|George wanders to the couch, Jerry following with his plate of pie and ice|
cream.
|Jerry puts down the plate, gets up and opens the door, to reveal a guy in a|
Plaza Cable cap.

|heh, two hours. You uh, happen to know where he is?|

Susan enters
|beautiful, don't you think? I wish I looked like that.|
|George daren't say anything, but from his expression it's clear he wishes|
Susan looked like that.
more than you like me.
Susan leaves to the bedroom.
|When Susan has gone, George picks up the phone and dials, keeping an eye|
open in case Susan returns.
Susan walks back in on George at this point. George quickly slips the phone
|under a cushion to conceal it, and goes back to watching My Cousin Vinnie,|
to provide an excuse for his raised voice.
Susan looks at him oddly.
|Jerry is packing some gear into a bag, while Elaine watches and Kramer peers|
out into the hall through Jerry's peephole.
Elaine seems to become a lot more interested in Jerry. She moves over to the
|table where Jerry's packing, and turns the 'flirt' knob to the 'on'|
position.
Kramer sees something through the peephole. He motions Jerry and Elaine to
quieten down.
|Nick, the cable guy is standing by Kramer's door. George wanders up to|
|Jerry's door and, as he gets there, is addressed.|
is wait. I'm getting pretty sick and tired of it. I'm not gonna put up with
it much longer.
|The cable guy stalks away. Inside Jerry's, Kramer turns to speak to Jerry|
and Elaine.
|Kramer lowers his eye to the peephole again, just as George opens the door.|
The door cracks Kramer on the forehead with a thump. George enters. Kramer
peers round George to check the cable guy's gone.
Kramer exits and crosses the hall to his apartment. George closes the door
|behind himself, and takes off his coat. He notices Elaine.|
|An Oscar winner! How can I live the rest of my life, knowing I coulda been|
|with Marisa Tomei? She said I was just her type! She loves short, stocky,|
balding funny men!
Jerry is standing by the kitchen counter. He has a stack of bank notes and
is counting them. Elaine is mesmerised by the sight of all that currency.
|She stands by the counter, her eyes locked onto the money.|
didn't hear what you said.
Elaine looks almost dizzy at the prospect of all that cash.
|Jerry resumes his counting, but has lost track of where he was up to. He|
|stands, holding one bill, trying to recall. Elaine has obviously been paying|
|more attention, even as she dialled the phone.|
|As Jerry goes to leave the kitchen, Elaine is sure to keep in his path,|
smiling flirtatiously.
|Jerry is finally allowed out of the kitchen by Elaine, and heads for the|
bedroom. The phone is picked up at the other end of Elaine's line. As Elaine
|speaks, George stands beside her, doing a little selection of dances.|
|Oh, really?|
Something about the tone of her voice causes George to cease dancing.

|The door opens and Jerry enters, carrying his bags.|
Morty follows Helen outside.
|Standing at the kerb is a brand new, silver, Cadillac, gleaming in the|
Floridian sunshine. Jerry leads Morty and Helen over to it.
|Helen makes another grab for the keys, and she and Morty struggle for|
|possession, watched by Jerry.|

Kramer puts down his paper and stretches out on the couch to listen.
|do than stand outside all morning, waiting for you to show up?!|
|Kramer waves his fist, mocking the cable guy's anger. He laughs to himself.|
|Morty is sitting in the Cadillac, with Jerry leaning on the door. They're|
going through the features of the car.
|moves it. I could be in prison for five years. I come out, my seat goes|
right back to where I like it.
|George sits, talking enthusiastically to someone.|
|The person he's talking to is Katy, who's unconscious, wearing an oxygen|
mask and has an intravenous drip in her.
|I said I was engaged, but (laughs) uh, you know, it's really just something|
|you say. It's like, going steady. You know uh, going steady, engaged, it's,|
|it's all just stuff you say. (chuckles) Anyway, I was watching uh, My Cousin|
|Vinnie, on the uh, on the tape the other day, and I was thinking that uh,|
|you know, the two of us might take a meeting, as they say. (chuckles) So,|
|what d'you, what d'you think?|
Katy is still unconscious.
Kramer is reading a magazine on the couch. The phone rings and he answers
it.

neighbourhood.
|Kramer walks over to his window, and uses his fingers to open a couple of|
|blades on his blinds. Peering through, he can see a public phone box across|
the street. Parked beside the box is a truck emblazoned with the Plaza Cable
|insignia, and in the box is the familiar figure of Nick, the cable guy.|

would know that.
stove.
Kramer puts the phone down beside a radio and switches it on. It plays
cheesy music into the phone. Kramer gets up and heads out the door.
|Nick, the cable guy, stands in the phone box. He's listening to the cheesy|
|music on the phone, and getting impatient. He glances at his watch.|
|Suddenly, a car horn blares and a shout is heard.|
|THe cable guy turns, to see Kramer leaning out of the window of a cab as it|
passes.
|Kramer waves and smiles happily at the dumbstruck cable guy, as the cab|
accelerates away.
|Around a table sit a number of residents, including an unhappy looking Jack|
Klompus. Morty is standing behind a lectern addressing the gathering. He
bangs a gavel to get their attention.
Morty looks dumbstruck.
|George sits on the couch, watching Only You on the video. Onscreen, the|
ever-lovely Marisa is delivering her lines.
|Marisa Tomei movie, and you've seen that one too. (jokingly) What, d'you|
have a thing for her?
|Marisa Tomei. Like she would ever go out with a short, stocky, bald man.|
|(forced laughter) Hu hu, ha ha. Like that's her type. Huh. She's an Oscar|
|winner. (nervous laughter) He heh. Besides, I don't even know her. It's not|
|like anyone's trying to fix us up. Who, who would try and fix me up with|
Marisa Tomei?
|Susan wanders away into the kitchen with the groceries, looking bemused by|
|George. George watches her go, staring at the kitchen door as he slips off|
into a daydream.
|George stares at the kitchen door, which glows with golden light. Then|
|Marisa Tomei slinks out of the kitchen in a long black dress, and her hair|
|up. She comes and sits beside George on the couch, looking at him lovingly.|
premiere.
George leans across and takes Marisa in his arms. They kiss and slowly
recline onto the couch.
|Susan returns from the kitchen, to find George kissing, and slowly reclining|
|onto the couch with, a cushion. George runs a hand across his head, in the|
fashion of a loving Marisa's caress. Then he raises his head from the
cushion to see Susan observing him. She turns and goes back into the
|kitchen, wordlessly. George puts the cushion on the arm of the couch and|
lies down.
|Jerry sits on the couch and Helen is in the kitchen, as an anxious Morty|
delivers his news.
|Jerry is trying, unsuccessfully, to sleep on the infamous fold-out. He twists and turns, but can't find a comfortable position.|
|Jerry puts down the phone, still a little bemused by Elaine.|
The phone rings and Kramer picks up.
|Somewhere outside, a guy in overalls and a safety helmet is on the phone. He's|
writing on a clipboard as he speaks to Kramer.
|Kramer gets a smile on his face, thinking it's another of the cable guy's|
tricks.
|seems some jokers were up on the roof, and they must've damaged some of the|
wires.
apartment and do a safety check.
|Kramer opens his blinds slightly, as he did before. But there is no cable guy in|
|the phone box across the street, only a woman talking on the phone.|
|Kramer hits a button to end the call, and puts the phone back on the table.|
|John, the power guy, stares at his phone in disbelief.|
|Elaine sits in a booth. George enters, looking unnaturally happy, and comes|
over.
And I wasn't even that nervous.
|Elaine watches George, as he rambles on.|
Why don't we pick up with this next week?
Elaine rises.
Hmm?
|Reluctantly, Elaine sits back down with a sigh, as George furrows his brow in|
concentration.
George and Elaine both think hard for a moment. Then Elaine gets a flash of
inspiration.
go with me.
Elaine smiles and makes a 'voila' gesture.
|together on a lie. Now, you don't understand how I work. I have a certain way of|
working. Jerry and I have worked together a few times. He knows how I work. It's
|not a personal thing, y'know? We're just trying to come up with the best|
possible lie. That's what this is all about.
The twosome go back to thinking for a while. This time George gets the
inspiration.
|thinking of quitting the exporting, and just focussing in on the importing. And|
|this is causing a problem, because, why not do both?|
|Elaine finishes with an expectant smile. George looks skeptical, and Elaine|
seems offended again.
|none of my ideas are getting in. You know, I mean, you just know it all and I am|
Miss Stupid. Right?
|George avoids Elaine's gaze, looking down.|
|Helen is in the kitchen, putting cookies on a plate, as a restless Morty fusses|
around.
you're wearing. Where did you get it?
Helen goes to the kitchen as Mrs Choate sits on the couch.
Mrs Choate turns to look at Jerry. Jerry looks astonished as he recognises Mrs
Choate. He remembers an incident from "The Rye".
|Jerry grapples with Mrs Choate, for possession of a bag.|
Jerry manages to regain a normal expression.
|New York, didn't you?|
Jerry looks desperate. The last thing he needs is Mrs Choate connecting him with
New York.
|there is just terrible. Do you know I got mugged for a marble rye, right on the|
street?
Jerry gives a look of sympathy. Helen brings a couple of saucers and cups from
|the kitchen, placing them on the table before Mrs Choate.|
|Susan sits on the couch, reading. She spots George, in his coat, heading for the|
door.
|the exporting and uh, focus just on the importing. And it's a problem, because|
she thinks the exporting is as important as the importing.
Susan looks unconvinced.
|Elaine?! If I was having an affair with Elaine, I wouldn't tell you I'm going to|
|see Elaine. I would make up some other person to tell you I was gonna go see,|
and then I would go see Ela..Elaine.
George gives a smile and slides out the door.
|Kramer strolls along the street, carrying a big bag of groceries. He becomes|
aware that a vehicle is slowly driving along the road just behind him. Kramer
|shifts his load of groceries, so that a shiny baking tray is in a position he|
|can use it as a mirror. Behind him, he can see the blurry image of a Plaza Cable|
|truck. Kramer begins to walk faster, then breaks into a run.|
|Kramer slows from his run, and looks behind himself. A smile comes to his face,|
as he sees the truck is no longer there. He allows himself a little shrug of
|satisfaction at having beaten the cable guy. Kramer turns and begins to walk on,|
|with his groceries, when there is a screech of tyres and the cable truck comes|
to a halt in front of him - having taken another route to head him off.
The cable guy gives a 'come here' gesture with his forefinger through the truck
|window. Kramer turns and sets off running. He runs into a litter bin, drops his|
groceries and falls to the floor. The cable guy climbs from his truck and begins
|to advance on Kramer. Kramer picks himself up and, abandoning his groceries,|
|sets off running again, with the cable guy in pursuit.|
|Kramer runs across a busy thoroughfare, followed, seconds later, by the cable|
guy.
|Kramer hauls himself over a wall in a park, looks around, and then sets off|
|running. Moments later, the cable guy struggles over the same wall and sets off|
after Kramer.
|Kramer runs across an expanse of grass in the park, with the cable guy just a|
few yards behind.
Kramer runs across a New York rooftop. He comes to the edge of the roof and
|looks for a way across to the next building. Kramer looks worriedly behind him,|
|for the pursuing cable guy, then down into the gap between buildings. Despite|
|his worry at the height, he steps back a few paces, takes a run-up, and leaps|
across to land on the roof of the next building. Kramer picks himself up and
|sets off running again. Behind him, the cable guy comes to the same gap, looks|
|down at how far he has to fall, and thinks better of attempting the leap.|
won't get away with this!
Morty is fastening a jacket as he enters.

|Jerry wanders into the room. He's in a t-shirt and sweatpants, and holding a|
comic book he's been reading.

|Jerry shakes his head, incredulous, and wanders away with his comic book.|
|George sits on a bench with Marisa Tomei. He's mid-speech, and Marisa's looking|
|interested, smiling and laughing.|
|word. I mean, it's 'newer', which is good, and a 'ma' in front of it, which is|
|also good. Ma-newer , right?|
'Ma' and the 'newer'.
Marisa laughs and George is smiling happily.
Marisa's expression turns to anger. She swings a fist and punches George in the
|face, then grabs her bag and storms away. George feels the painful spot where he|
received the blow.
A few people stand around outside. The Seinfeld's Cadillac drives up to the
|front of the restaurant. There's a gap in the parked cars, right by the|
entrance.
The Cadillac pulls into the space. From the entrance of Scott's emerge Jack and
|Doris Klompus, Jack using a toothpick|
|well-to-do president. But, you enjoy your last meal in office. Tomorrow, they|
|kick you out, you'll have plenty of time to drive around in your Cadillac.|
|Morty is looking confident, even smug.|
|The Seinfelds enter Scott's, and Jack and Doris walk past the Cadillac.|
|Elaine answers a knock at the door, to find a slightly anxious looking Susan.|
wanna sleep...
|Elaine realises who she's speaking to, and the laughter dies away.|
|because, you know, Art and I were getting into this whole thing about his|
|business. Uhm, you know he's an importer-exporter.|
|The moment the door closes behind Susan, Elaine races to her phone and dials a|
|number hurriedly. She stands, listening to the ring, desperate for a response.|
|Susan stands sifting through some magazines, when the door opens and George|
enters. He's still feeling his face where Marisa punched him.
|Susan raises her arm, and delivers the second punch that George has received|
|today. George is thrown backwards out of the door by the blow, and Susan slams|
the door behind him.
Around the table are the board of phase two. Morty and Jack sit beside each
|other. Herb is chairing the meeting, and several other representatives are|
|present, some chatting with each other. Herb spots Mrs Choate coming in through|
the door.
|We're calling this emergency meeting of the board of phase two, to consider a|
|motion of impeachment of our president, (indicating) Morty Seinfeld.|
Mrs Choate sits beside Morty.
|Mrs Choate overhears Jack's comment, and it stirs a memory. She thinks back.|
Jerry and Mrs Choate struggle for possession of a bag containing a marble rye.
Mrs Choate wears a look of shocked realisation. She stands and addresses Morty.
|vice-president, Jack Klompus, in accordance with the phase two constitution, is|
hereby installed as president.
Jack stands to acknowledge the honour.
|Jack raises a hand in salute, as the rest of the board applaud him. A|
disgruntled Morty remains silent.
|A weary looking Nick, the cable guy, leans against Kramer's door. He knocks and|
there's no response.
okay? You win. I can't do it any more. What d'you want from me? Apology?
|Alright, I'm sorry. There, I said it, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I see now how we|
made you feel when we made you sit home waiting. I dunno why we do it. (upset) I
|guess maybe we just kind of enjoy taking advantage of people. (reasonable) Well,|
|that's gonna change. From now on, no more 'nine to twelve', no more 'one to|
five'. We're gonna have appointments. Eleven o'clock is gonna mean eleven
|o'clock. And, if we can't make it, we're gonna call you, tell you why. (worked|
|up) For god's sakes, if a doctor can do it, why can't we? (almost sobbing)|
|Anyway, that's it.|
|The cable guy sighs, and begins to walk away. Kramer's door opens, and Kramer|
emerges. He and Nick look at each other apologetically for a few seconds. Then
Kramer steps forward and they hug.
|Morty comes in from the bedroom, looking around at his home. Helen holds his|
coat as he slips into it. She adjusts his collar and hands him a blue hat. Jerry
enters through the front door.
|Jerry leads the way, followed by Helen, who folds a coat over her arm. Morty|
|waits a second or two, having a final look round the room. He stands by the|
|door, then steels himself. Giving a determined nod, he exits, closing the door|
behind him.
|The Seinfelds walk, three abreast, toward the Cadillac. As they walk, they pass the other residents, who have come to see them off. They nod acknowledgement. As they get to the car, Helen and Jerry get in, but Morty stands in the open door of the Cadillac, turns to the assembled throng and gives a big smile, and arms-wide gesture (like Nixon leaving the White House), before climbing into the car. The residents wave back, one or two of them in tears, and Morty slowly drives the Cadillac away.|
|There's always that one location, one store location that's constantly changing hands. Everybody has this in their neighborhood, it's a leather store, it's a yogurt shop, it's a pet supply. It's constantly changing and nobody can do business there. It's like some sort of Bermuda triangle of retail, you know? Stores open up and then they just disappear without a trace. Nobody knows what happened to 'em. I guess eventually when like aliens land in mother ship of close encounters, bottom will slowly open and all these store owners will come wondering out in a daze going 'I thought there would be more walk-in traffic didn't you?.'|
|You know the IQ test has always that sample question at the beginning where they show how to fill in the circle. It should be the first eliminating point right there.

|It's tough to do a good deed. Just look at your professional good deed doers. Your lone rangers, your superman, your Batman, your Spiderman, your Elasticman. They are all wearing disguises, masks over their faces. Secret identities. Don't want people to know who they are. It's too much aggravation.

Jerry and Elaine begin to walk along the street.
|The room is stylishly furnished. A number of people sit around, chatting and|
|drinking. Elaine and her new boyfriend, Brett, walk across the room, carrying|
drinks.
Music begins to play. It's The Eagles' Desperado. Brett hears the music and
|is enraptured. He stares off into the distance, oblivious to everything but|
the song.
|Brett hasn't heard a word of what Elaine said, continuing to stare off into|
the distance.
|Elaine stares at Brett and puts a hand to her chest, moved by his|
sensitivity.
|Jerry and Elaine come round the corner, past the Chinese restaurant and walk|
along the street.
|Ahead of the strolling twosome, a guy stands on the sidewalk, twirling a|
brightly-coloured umbrella over his shoulder.

Kramer sits on the couch and flinches as he sits on the umbrella. He reaches

|He gets back up, and heads to the kitchen.|

a Farbman.
George wanders over.
|Kramer and Jerry stroll along. Jerry is massaging his left hand, as if it's|
giving him discomfort.
Jerry and Kramer draw level with three Japanese tourists. One of them steps
|forward, holding out a camera.|
Jerry has spotted something further along the street. It's another umbrella
|salesman, twirling his wares.|
|Jerry walks along to the guy. Kramer fusses about, taking a picture of the|
|three Japanese guys, at one point he steps back to frame them all, and|
stumbles off the curb.
|that, don't you?|
|Back down the street, Kramer has finished photographing. He looks over toward|
|Jerry, and thinks for a second.|
|Jerry has taken one of the umbrellas, and is demonstrating the twirl to the|
|guy. He's speaking animatedly, with lots of hand gestures and arm waving.|
Kramer and the three guys look along to where Jerry is still talking
vigorously to the umbrella guy.

|Jerry is tossing the umbrella from hand to hand, with the unimpressed guy|

|Kramer and the Japanese all laugh uproariously, watching Jerry.|
Three guys in bright yellow overalls stand in George's living room. Two of
|them have a large carpet cleaner by the door, ready to leave, The third, the|
|leader, has a notebook.|
The carpet cleaners begin to leave. George follows the leader toward the
|door, looking disappointed.|
The leader closes the door on a perplexed George.
|Jerry sits at his table. He's signing checks, and holding his pen awkwardly|
in his hand which is twisted uncomfortably. Elaine enters and notices his
hand.
Jerry holds up his twisted hand in greeting. Brett copies the position of the
fingers in his wave back.

Brett opens the door.
Kramer and the Japanese tourists are looking at stuff. Kramer picks up a
Stetson and reads the price tag.

Kramer hands Stetsons to each of the other Japanese.

|Desperado comes on the radio. Brett immediately breaks off the kiss, and|
stares off into the distance again.

strolls over to the booth.
Jerry) They're known as gift-givers. And tonight we're going dancing at the
Rainbow Room.
|you eat, I mean, even that kimono you wear. Where to you think all that money|

Jerry looks puzzled.
They broadcast a lot of American baseball. They got an office here in New
York!
|TV, all you see is four morons sitting round an apartment, whining about|
their dates!
Jerry looks doubtful.
|Japan, you're an exotic fruit. Like an orange. Which is rare there.|
|Jerry looks at George, wondering.|
|Jerry and George sit on a couch. Two Japanese TV executives, one male, one|
|female, sit on chairs. They are all watching the pilot show Jerry made at the|
end of Season 4. The Japanese are not looking impressed. George is smiling
|and pointing, enthusiastically. On a coffee table sits a large bowl|
containing a plastic bag of oranges.

no oranges.
|Jerry nods, sagely, and picks up a cup of coffee. His fingers are still|
twisted from the check signing.
Jerry pats George on the knee. George squeezes Jerry's shoulder and they
ruefully begin to depart.
|Jerry sits at his table, signing yet more checks, the pen gripped in his|
|clawed fingers. Elaine stands in her jacket, her bag on the table.|
|The door opens and Kramer enters, wearing his suit and carrying another fat|
envelope.
Kramer puts the envelope down on the table next to Jerry. Elaine walks to the
kitchen.
fifty thousand yen.
|Elaine is in the kitchen, eating cereal from the box.|
Up against one wall of the apartment stands a very large chest of three
drawers. It's about six feet long and each drawers is maybe a foot and a half
deep. Kramer walks over to it and looks into the open top drawer.
|Mr Tanaka lies down again, and Kramer slides the drawer shut. He then speaks|
to the occupant of the next drawer.
|Mr Oh lies back down and Kramer slides the drawers shut, and speaks to the|
final drawer's occupant.
|Mr Yamaguchi lies down. Kramer shuts the final drawer, switches off the lamp|
|and, yawning, walks off toward his own bed|
|Kramer is in the kitchen. He has three bowls out on the counter, and a box of|
|Rice Crispies. Jerry walks over, pushing a bunch of checks into an envelope.|
Kramer fetches out milk and continues making breakfast.
Elaine and Brett sit in the parked Ferrari. Witchy Woman is playing on the
|stereo. Elaine is listening, with her eyes closed and her head nodding. Brett|
looks puzzled.
There is a flash of lightning and thunder rolls. Elaine peers out at the
weather.
The top and bottom drawers are open in the chest. Mr Yamaguchi sits up in the
|bottom drawer, and Mr Tanaka sits on top of the chest, with his feet in his|
drawer. Kramer comes over and hands bowls of Rice Crispies to the pair of
them.
Kramer looks impatient. He puts the bowl of Rice Crispies on top of the chest
and walks off mumbling irritably.
|It is pouring with rain. Jerry walks along the street, wearing just a light|
jacket over his clothes. He still has the envelope in his hands. Jerry spots
|the umbrella vendor, twirling his wares.|
eighty-four? I almost lost my house.
|A guy comes along the street, wearing one of Elaine's urban sombreros. Clicky|
tries to catch his attention.
The rain continues to pour down unabated.
|George is removing a tape from a VCR. Kramer enters, followed by the three|
|Japanese tourists. Outside the window, the rain can be seen bucketing down.|
|Now, bear in mind, they're a little light on the yen.|
|George thinks for a minute, then looks down at the tape in his hands.|

The Japanese nod to each other.

Kramer and George wave the Japanese toward seats. Kramer leaves the office
and looks down the corridor. He raises his arm to attract attention.

|Jerry walks along. He is still carrying the envelope of checks, and by now|
|he's drenched. A familiar red Ferrari pulls to a stop level with Jerry, and|
the window winds down.
Jerry looks down at the envelope of checks in his hands. The rain has soaked
them so thoroughly that the ink of his signatures has run and become
illegible.
Jerry walks away
|Jerry is drying the checks. Dozens hang from lines around the apartment, and|
|more sit on the table, where Jerry dabs them with a towel.|
|Elaine puts he hand to her head, walks round the room and flops onto the|
couch. The door opens and George enters. He's in buoyant mood.

George opens the door. Jerry comes over before he can leave.
is. (vehement) Just take it!
|George smiles, claps Jerry on the shoulder and leaves. Jerry starts to close|
|the door, but George turns back.|
Jerry swings the door closed in George's face.
|George crosses the hall to Kramer's door. He knocks, but there is no|
|immediate reply. George listens, and can hear excited shouting and laughter.|
He opens the door and goes in.
Kramer and the three Japanese sit in the hot-tub. They're stripped to the
|waist (at least), wearing Stetsons, and drinking sake. They spot George as he|
enters and shout greetings.
All the Japanese gesture and shout that George should get in the tub with
them.

|Kramer and the Japanese cheer and splash water at George, who leaves. Then|
they go back to knocking back sake.
Jerry is re-signing all the checks he dried out.
Jerry completes his signature and drops the pen from his claw-like hand. It's
clearly painful.
George stands outside the Nakahama Broadcast Corp offices. He's waiting for
someone. Kramer wanders up behind him and speaks into George's ear.

A panicky George rushes toward a payphone.
Jerry is bathing his crippled left hand in a bowl of ice-water. The phone
rings and he picks up (with his right).
|hot-tub! You gotta get 'em outta the drawers and get 'em down here, or I|
don't have a focus group to sell the pilot to Japanese TV!
George begins hammering the phone against the kiosk. Jerry lifts the phone
away from his ear at the noise.
|The chest of drawers still stands against one wall. All the drawers are shut,|
and from within them can be heard thumping noises and cries for help. Jerry
enters and hears the calls.
|Jerry pulls at the handle with his good hand, but it won't move. He tries to|
hook his bad hand round the other handle and pull.
Elaine and Brett stroll up to Jerry's door. Brett is carrying an umbrella.
Elaine looks dubious.
|Elaine reaches for Jerry's doorhandle, but a shout from Kramer's apartment|
distracts her.
Elaine enters followed by Brett.
|Jerry stands in front of the chest of drawers, holding a large fireman's axe.|
|He swings it high and smashes it into the top of the chest, the wood|
|splintering under the impact. Brett looks horrified. He drops the umbrella,|
and rushes forward to protect the furniture.
Elaine stares after the charging Brett. She puts her hand to her mouth and
|screams, horrified at what she sees.|
|The Japanese tourists sit on the couch, looking like survivors of some|
|horrible ordeal, with the two executives in their chairs. George perches on|
the arm of the couch.

|The tourists turn slowly and look nervously at the smiling, uncomprehending,|

|Behind the couch, two of the carpet cleaner people enter, including the|

|The leader shrugs, as if to say 'You work it out.'|

destructive influence you've had over her life lo these many years..

There she'll get the structure an' the discipline she needs right now..
And she'll have qualified officers telling her what to do..

Jerry's standup piece.
|they seem to just freeze that clothing style and just ride it out to the end,|
|don't they? And it's not like they don't continue shopping, it's just they|
somehow manage to find new old clothes. Every father is like this fashion time
|capsule, you know what I mean. It's like they should be on a pedestal, with|
someone next to 'em going 'This was nineteen sixty-five'. To me the worst thing
is shopping for pants. I hate dressing and undressing in that little room. What
|men need is a place to shop where you go in, you check your pants at the door,|
and you just walk around the store in your underwear. That would be the best
|way. Then you'd really have to lie to the salesman. 'Need some help?' 'No, just|
getting some air.'

Kramer enters from bathroom. He's holding some brightly coloured objects in his
hand and obviously has an unpleasant taste in his mouth.

A passenger walking down the carriage grabs the gyro from Kramer's hand and sits
down to eat it. Kramer extracts his arm and the doors slam closed.

Elaine is looking like she'd rather be anywhere else.

Jerry is pouring glasses of Perrier in the kitchen while Winona looks around.
|Elaine is eating her gyro. As she does, unseen by her, juices from her sandwich|

Frank and Ricky are going through Frank's TV Guide collection. The coffee table
is covered in boxes of the magazine.

Elaine sits alone in her seat. Jerry tries to enter the carriage just as the

Elaine gets a flicker of recognition. She lifts up the TV Guide and finds the

at the real guy again and he has the exact expression as the picture on the
cover.

|A group of staff, including George, are gathered round the table. There's a bunch of food on the table. Most people have a small plate with a few salad leaves on it in front of them. George is picking shrimp off a platter, dipping them in some sort of sauce, and stuffing his face with them, about as fast as he can manage.|
|Everyone at the table starts laughing uproariously at Reilly's joke. George looks upset, and barely forces half a sick smile past his mouthful of seafood.|

has heard his shouts.

for the day.
Kramer looks anxious again.
Jerry and Milos are playing at the other tennis club. They are watched by a
|small number of people, including Patty. Milos delivers a weak underarm|
|serve, and Jerry makes no effort to return it, merely wafting his racquet|
vaguely in the direction of the ball.
|ease up. He can't handle this, so he cries like a woman! (laughs evilly)|
Hahaha!
|Milos strides away to continue the game, leaving Jerry looking rueful.|
|Elaine walks down a hallway, carrying a large grocery bag. She reads numbers|
|off doors until she spots the one she wants. She gives a smile, flicks her|
|hair a little, and knocks at the door.|
|The door cracks open a few inches, but it's completely dark inside, so the|
occupant can't be seen.
|just, I know you feel what I feel.|
A woman comes up behind Elaine.
|The woman pushes the door wide open, revealing Vincent standing there.|
|Vincent is a bespectacled, geeky, teen in a plaid shirt. He throws his hands|
up to cover his face.
Vincent darts away from the door into the apartment. Elaine is open-mouthed
in surprise.
Vincent's mother grabs the top of the bag and begins to rummage through the
contents.
|Elaine smiles and nods, and pulls at a chain she has round her neck. Threaded|
onto the chain is the VCR button Vincent sent her.
|Vincent's mother holds out her hand, and Elaine pulls the chain over her head|
and hands it over.
Elaine reaches into the grocery bag and extracts the bottle of vodka. She
|drops the rest of the bag on the floor, and strolls away, swinging the bottle|
like a club.
|Jerry and Milos are still playing. Jerry is still throwing the game, and|
Milos is still milking it. Jerry puts an easy return straight into the court
in front of himself.
|Jerry) Hey, big baby, are you wetting yourself? Maybe it is time for you to|
be changed. (laughter) Hahah.
|Patty laughs too, with the few other spectators. Jerry looks angry at this|
constant derision.
|Jerry delivers a fierce serve which beats Milos, and almost hits him in the|
face.
Huhuh. The baby got lucky on that one! Hahah.
Jerry walks back to deliver another serve. Kramer enters and looks around for
|someone. On another court, Shellbach is facing an automatic serving machine.|
|Shellbach waves vaguely back to Kramer, who has begun to walk round the room|
to get to him.
|Meanwhile, Jerry returns a shot to Milos, with some venom. Milos stretches|
|desperately to try and reach it, but loses his grip on his racquet. The|
|racquet arcs across the hall, watched by Patty, and then spotted by Kramer.|
The racquet plummets from the air and strikes the guy who is operating the
|automatic serving machine for Shellbach. The guy is knocked unconscious and,|
|as he falls, he pushes against the machine, turning it to point at Kramer.|
|Kramer stands transfixed, as it continues to launch balls at him. Several|
|balls in rapid succession strike him in the head, until he slumps,|
|unconscious, to the floor.|

Reilly and everyone else laughs even more than they did before. George looks

occurs to him.
|George looks round, smiling arrogantly, expecting laughter. But there is a|
|deep, uncomfortable, silence. Reilly, looks stony-faced. McAdam stands and|
leans over to speak in George's ear.
George looks sick.
|Kramer lies in bed, asleep. Jerry sits in a chair, reading a newspaper.|
|There's a knock at the door and Elaine enters, carrying a VCR.|
Elaine walks over and sees both sockets are full. She takes hold of one of
the plugs and yanks it out of the socket with a grunt. The grunt wakes
|Kramer, who looks groggily around and sees Elaine standing holding the plug,|
|as if she's just unplugged his life support. He stares, bug-eyed and shrieks|
in terror.

|face. He swings the car round with a squeal of tires, and heads back towards|

|I'm gonna come by. Alright. (Hangs up, slamming it down on the coffee table. He sits down next to Jerry) My mother wants me to see a psychiatrist now. Why?!|

Finally at The Plaza Hotel
|Jerry comes in from the street and walks toward the elevators. A doorman, stood|
|reading a newspaper on a counter, objects. There's an undertone to the doorman's|
|voice - unfriendly, contemptuous, even an edge of menace.|
|should just shut up and do my job, opening the door for you.|
The doorman wanders back to his newspaper. Jerry shrugs and pushes the button
for one of the elevators. There's a pause as he waits for it to arrive. The
|doorman stands holding his paper, staring at Jerry, with the unfriendly smile on|
his face. Jerry throws a smile of his own back. The elevator is still not
moving. Jerry tries to break the uncomfortable silence.
|know, because I'm the uneducated doorman.|
|Jerry turns away and looks at the indicator, hoping that the elevator will come|
and rescue him.
George and Kramer walk along together.
|kasha, it stinks up the whole house.|
|Kramer has noticed a 'Sightseeing Tour' bus on the street, with a German flag|
painted on the door. It gives him an idea. Kramer steps in front of George and
brings them to a halt.
New York mugging. It'll give them a thrill.
|Kramer pushes his hand deep into a pocket and raises his arm, giving the|
impression that he has a gun concealed beneath his coat.
|On the tourist bus, the occupants attention is attracted. They look out the|
|window at the 'mugging'. George has his hands up, and Kramer is feeling through|
George's pockets with his free hand.
|The tourist are looking out of the bus. Shocked, they knock on the glass. Kramer|
grabs George by the collar of his jacket and is shaking him violently.
|better not say anything, or I'll stalk you!|
|Kramer walks away. The tourists stare, horrified at what they've witnessed.|
Elaine admits Jerry to the apartment.
Jerry and Elaine sit on the couch to wait. They simultaneously look at their
watches.
|George and Kramer wear their jackets, ready to leave. Frank is in a shirt,|
mixing a bowl (of kasha?) as they talk.
|George and Kramer stand together, by George's computer. Frank unfastens his|
shirt and opens it. Kramer and George turn and see Frank's torso exposed as the
|shirt comes off. Kramer's eyebrows go up in surprise. George looks horrified,|
and puts his hand to his mouth like he's going to vomit.
|Elaine still sits on the couch. Jerry is standing at the window, holding the|
curtain open and looking down at the street.
can you grab those empty bottles for me.
Jerry picks up a paper sack of empty bottles from the floor by the desk.
Jerry gives an irritated glance upwards and goes to leave.
Jerry emerges from the elevator (without the bottles). There is a new doorman on
|duty, who gives Jerry a friendly nod and smile and holds the door open for him.|
|Jerry nods and smiles back, and leaves.|
Elaine is kneeling with the phone. She has Mr. Pitt's mail spread out on the
floor in front of her and is going through it for Mr. Pitt's benefit.
|Jerry walks down the street. He passes a doorway, where stands a familiar|
figure. The doorman still has the attitude problem.
Goodbye.
Jerry walks away.
you?!
|George and Kramer sit one side of a booth, facing Jerry. George is wearing a|
purple shirt. Kramer's eating a sandwich heartily. George looks as if he might
never want to eat again.
|George nods, Jerry has a confused expression. Kramer keeps on eating. Jerry|
|thinks for a moment, George can't even look anyone in the eye.|
|George snaps his finger and points, in agreement with Jerry. He continues to|
look deeply worried.
Kramer leaves. A buxom blonde woman in a purple shirt is making her way to the
|door, as she passes the booth she notices George.|
The woman smiles and leaves. Elaine enters Monk's and comes over to Jerry. She's
not happy about something.
|Elaine looks over at George, wondering what he's doing. George is holding the|
|neck of his shirt open, and is peering down the inside of the garment at his|
|chest. As Elaine and Jerry watch, George jiggles his upper body, to see if|
there's any movement.
|George ends his experiment, and rises to leave. He digs in his wallet to pay the|
cheque.

|Jerry enters from the street, only to find the unpleasant doorman standing|
inside the lobby. The doorman's demeanour hasn't improved.

a doorman in my building. I guess I'm just not used to talking to them. I'd
really just like to be friends.
|And, if they don't live here, don't let them in. (takes off his hat) Here.|
(putting it on Jerry's head) Wear that.
|The doorman goes out the door. Jerry takes off the hat, which he's not thrilled|
|about wearing, and leans on the counter. The doors of an elevator open, and a|
|young woman pushing a baby buggy emerges and heads for the exit. After a second,|
Jerry realises his job. He puts on the hat and opens the door to allow the woman
|to leave. AS he opens the door, a man enters and strolls past Jerry into the|
elevator vacated by the woman.
|The man takes no notice of Jerry, the doors close. The street door opens and|
|another, older guy, enters. Jerry moves and challenges him.|
|Now, if you don't let me in, I'm going to call the police and have you arrested.|
|Jerry steps aside and motions for the guy to carry on into the building, but he|
looks resentful about it.
|George is riding the bus. As the vehicle travels along the street, it rattles,|
shakes and shudders like all poorly maintained public transport. George is
|strap-hanging, and he gets a worried look as he feels there might be some|
|movement on his chest. He puts his hands on his chest, then notices another guy|
|on the buss looking at him. Self-consciously, George pulls his coat tight shut,|
and crosses his arms firmly.
|Jerry is standing behind the counter, reading the doorman's newspaper. A FedEx|
|delivery guy enters with a package, lays it on the counter and scans a barcode|
|on it with a little device he takes from his pocket. Jerry watches,|
|disinterested. There is a brief pause, as the FedEx guy waits for something.|
|Jerry takes the FedEx guy's pen and signs for the package, then goes back to the|
newspaper.
|The FedEx guy leaves, looking a touch unhappy at Jerry's attitude. Jerry puts|
|the paper down, and goes to have a look through the door. There's no sign of the|

the hand as he moves to the elevator.

|Kramer dumps the record player on the chair. Frank goes to the couch, not moving|
very easily.

Kramer brings out a garment constructed of canvas and elasticated fabric.
Estelle is driving a preoccupied-looking George.
Elaine and Jerry ride down.
|The bell rings as they reach the lobby, and the doors open.|
Elaine and Jerry emerge into the lobby to find four or five tenants standing
|around, and a uniformed cop taking notes.|
Elaine and Jerry depart the scene of the crime in some haste.
Frank's cha-cha record is playing loudly on the record player. Frank and Kramer
|are half-dancing to the music, as Frank tries on the bro. Kramer stands behind|
|Frank, making adjustments to the garment. The door opens and George and Estelle|
|enter. They see the dancing twosome, and the undergarment, and look stunned.|
|George is frozen, staring. Kramer carries on dancing, behind a relatively|
unfazed Frank.
|The lighting, with moonlight coming through the blinds, and Elaine's red dress,|
give a very noirish look to the scene.

|Behind Mrs. Payton, Elaine enters from the street and strolls to the elevator.|
|Elaine turns as she hears this, and Mrs. Payton goes to talk to her. Elaine|
|looks a tad worried at first but, of course, she has a plan.|
doesn't he?
|Meanwhile, the doorman has discovered something behind the counter. He brings|
out the FedEx package Jerry signed for and carried it toward Mrs. Payton.
Jerry Seinfeld signed for this package (handing the package to Mrs. Payton) at
the exact same time the couch was stolen.
|Mrs. Payton and the doorman both look at Elaine. Elaine looks sick, as she's|
caught out.

how to do anything.
The doorman walks silently away with the package and a quiet smile of triumph.

|The doorman stands behind his counter, smiling at Elaine's discomfiture.|
|Jerry and a downcast George sit one side of a booth, with an animated Elaine|
facing them.
|Jerry stares off, as he imagines...|
|In the lobby of Mr. Pitt's building, a bunch of doormen stand around the|
|unpleasant doorman, laughing at his tale.|
The doormen whoop it up again

|Kramer hovers behind Frank, waiting to leave.|

|you, if I were to ask her out?|
Frank storms out in a rage. Kramer gives Farkus an 'I'll calm him down' look and
follows Frank out the door.
|Frank and Kramer have just arrived, to find George packing a suitcase.|
|my underwear. As soon as he leaves the house, he turns into J. Edgar Hoover!|
|As Estelle speaks, Frank goes into the bedroom and brings out the record player.|
|George has picked up Frank's three suitcases, and is all ready to help carry|
them out to the car.
George drops the cases in disappointment.
The German sightseeing bus comes to a halt at the kerb. Kramer comes around the
|corner, carrying the record player in his arms. An elderly woman, one of the|
|witnesses to the 'mugging' of George, recognises Kramer as he passes. She climbs|
out of the bus and points after Kramer.
Kramer looks back at the sound and sees the woman coming after him. He turns
back and continues walking. The other German tourists get off the bus and join
the woman as she follows Kramer.
|Kramer looks worried and continues to carry his record player, pushing past|
bystanders as the tourists close on him.
Help. Stop him.
|Kramer dives into a doorway, but the doors are locked, so he's trapped by the|

Jerry and Elaine have just dropped off the couch into the lobby. Mrs. Payton
regards it critically. The doorman stands in the background as the delivery men
leave.

not happy.
|Poppie sinks onto the couch, despite the pleas, and horrified expressions, of|
Jerry and Elaine.
|George sits up in bed reading a magazine. Frank enters, carrying a small bowl.|
|George puts his magazine to one side, as Frank carefully climbs into bed whilst|
|keeping hold of the bowl. George takes off his glasses, as Frank settles back.|
|Picking up a spoon from the bowl Frank is about to eat, when a thought occurs.|
|Carefully, Frank reaches over with the spoon, to offer George a taste.|
George looks disdainfully at the spoonful. A few morsels have fallen onto the
|bedclothes, George picks them up and puts them back into Frank's bowl.|
|Wearily, George puts his glasses on the bedside table, and switches off his bedside lamp, bringing darkness to the room. George shuffles down beneath the bedclothes, to get comfortable, just as Frank switches on his bedside lamp.|
|Exasperated, George lifts his pillow and places it over his own face, as Frank continues to eat his kasha.|

Mrs. C Yes.

Lady Roxy! Where have you been? We've been worried sick about you. What's this? Hmm. Rudy's.
Jerry and Elaine sit side by side on a subway train. They're both reading
|newspapers, when something occurs to Jerry.|
They shrug and return to their reading.
George is sitting at the counter perusing a magazine. The waitress comes over
to take his order.
|The waitress disappears out back. George goes back to reading. Behind him, a|
|beautiful woman enters, and approaches him.|
The waitress returns from the back and puts a plate down on the counter
before George.

Kramer holds the shirt up against Jerry and admires it. On the front of the

Now it's Danielle's time to look surprised and bewildered.

|From the exit emerge several of Elaine's friends, who hurry over to see her.|
They're all holding tissues.
Blaine gives Elaine a strange look.
Jerry and Morty walk into a room which contains some fitness equipment -
|exercise bike, weights, etc.|
|In through the door comes a really old guy. He jogs slowly in, and begins|
doing physical jerks as Morty talks to Jerry.
|Mandelbaum. He's eighty years old, but strong as an ox. (pointing) Watch|
this.
Izzy picks up a set of weights and lifts them chest high.
Another guy enters behind the Seinfelds. He walks over to an exercise bike
and climbs aboard.
Izzy looks over. He releases his grip on the weights and they drop to the
floor with a clunk.
|Jerry puts down the weights, and rolls them out of the way. Izzy steps in|
|front of a much, much, more substantial set of weights.|
Izzy bends and takes hold of the bar. The second he puts any effort into the
|lift, there is a loud crunching noise and a pained look of horror comes to|
his face.
Izzy keeps hold of the bar as he slowly keels over forwards. The circular
weights roll in front of him and Izzy gently falls forward until he's face
down on the floor.
There's room for one more.
|Elaine is at the same movie theatre as before,but alone this time. She's|
buying her ticket from the booth.

|Elaine turns to enter the theatre, and meets Gail, Carol and Lisa coming out.|
|Helen is talking to Jerry, with Morty on the couch. Helen and Morty are in|
their nightclothes. Morty has on the '#1 DAD' shirt.
|Now, goodnight.|
Morty begins to head to the bedroom.
There is a knock at the door. Jerry answers it. Outside are three
Hispanic-looking guys.

The guys enter.
|Jerry stares, stunned.|
|Kramer stands, shirtless, in Jerry's kitchen. There's a pot on the stove, and|
Kramer's chopping vegetables on a board. The phone rings and Kramer answers.
|In the Seinfelds' condo, the three guys are asleep on the fold-out couch and|
|a chair, while an upset Jerry rants into the phone.|
Kramer hangs up the phone.
George and Danielle walk up to her door in her building. George has a napkin
in his hand on which is some scribbled numbers. Danielle is looking at
|George, very much as if she's interested.|

|Danielle gives George a big smile. George smiles, but thoughtfully.|
|Danielle leans toward George, for a kiss. But George walks away completely|
oblivious to Danielle.
|Danielle looks down the hall after George, looking perplexed.|
An unhappy Elaine sits at the counter as the waitress pours her coffee.
|I don't even like, they won't talk to me. (face-pulling) All because I don't|
like that stupid English Patient movie.
|(irritated) You know, sex in a tub. That doesn't work!|
Jerry and Morty stroll into the bedroom of the hugely impressive Mandelbaum
condo. Morty is still wearing the '#1 DAD' shirt under his tracksuit. Izzy is
asleep in the bed.
how sorry I was that you hurt yourself.
Izzy stares at Morty as Jerry speaks.
|commission, so (indicates Morty) you can strut around in your fancy number|
|one shirt. (moves the bedcovers) Well, I'll show you who's number one.|
Izzy starts to move to get out of bed.
Izzy stands up and there is a familiar crunching noise. Izzy freezes in his
|stance, arms raised.|
|Jerry darts out of the door, followed moments later by Morty.|
|Jerry has just returned from Florida, and is putting away his bag. A worried|
George sits at the table.

Peterman stuffs some paperwork into a desk drawer.
|Izzy is in a hospital bed, as Jerry stands beside it.|
|So if there's anything else I can do, please don't hesitate to, uh, try and|
find my number.
Jerry turns to walk out.
Izzy rummages on his bedside table and picks up a t-shirt. He holds it up to
his chest so Jerry can read what's written on it. 'World's Greatest
|Behind Jerry, an elderly bald guy leans round the doorframe and raps on the|
|door, attracting Izzy's attention.|
|Izzy Jr takes a grip on the TV, but there's another crunching sound as he|
|tries to lift, and an agonised expression comes to his face. Jerry cringes in|
the background.
|A suit-wearing Kramer is in the office of Earl Haffler - cigar-smoking,|
|stetson-wearing, Texan businessman.|
|Kramer calls a few words of nonsense Spanish out of the door, and the three|
guys stroll in. They are dressed in Castro-style green fatigues and caps.
|Danielle and George walk over to, and sit in, a booth.|
|Danielle smiles at George, still a touch confused.|
Peterman and Elaine sit in the auditorium. The English Patient is playing and
many of the crowd are tearfully dabbing their eyes. Peterman is particularly
|emotional. Elaine looks completely bored, and is tossing pieces of popcorn up|
in the air to try and catch them in her mouth.
One of Elaine's bits of popcorn misses her mouth and falls behind her seat.
|Elaine twists round and reaches over to retrieve it, before slumping in her|
seat wearily.

bottle of some anti-acid medication.

|Kramer sidles into the coffee shop. He peers past the register, to where the|
|three guys are sitting in the far corner, talking together. Then he moves|
over to join Jerry and George.
|Jerry and George look as if they're infected by Kramer's nervousness, as they|
try and look surreptitiously at the Dominicans.

|In the corner, one of the Dominicans thumps the table, as if to underscore a|
point in his argument.
|people get restless, who do you think they come after? (pointing to himself,|
shrill) El Presidente!
|Again, one of the Dominicans thumps the table. Kramer jumps at the sound.|
Izzy and Izzy Jr are laid up in beds placed side-by-side.
An even more elderly guy than Izzy enters the room behind Jerry. He spreads
his arms in greeting to the Mandelbaums.
All three of the Mandelbaums are in a row of beds in the same room.
|Jerry walks to the TV and picks it,and the attached cabinet up. HE carries it|
|across the room to the foot of Izzy Sr.'s bed,where he places it.|
Peterman and Elaine are still in front of The English Patient. Peterman
|stares, enraptured, at the screen. Elaine is totally frantic with boredom.|
|long. (to the screen) Quit telling your stupid story, about the stupid|
|desert, and just die already! (louder) Die!!|
|The other movie patrons turn and shush Elaine, who sits back in her seat.|
Elaine hurriedly gets out of her seat and leaves.
|Jerry and Elaine sit in a booth, talking over coffee.|
It's like they're rolling a double corona.
|The three Dominican guys are making crepes, and then rolling them around|
fillings.
The Dominican smiles back.
|Over in another part of the restaurant, Danielle sits in a booth with Neil.|
|Neil is clearly bald, but has his back to the camera.|
The Dominicans are handing out plates of rolled crepes to various tables.
At one table a customer prods a rolled crepe with his fork and a jet of
scalding hot filling squirts out into his face.
|At another table, another customer digs his fork in, and is rewarded with a|
faceful of blistering filling.
Neil sticks his fork into his crepe and recoils as hot liquid jets into his
face.
|The restaurant is in chaos as yells of pain come from all sides. Elaine,|
Jerry and Kramer look round at the commotion.
|tight. (regretful) Uhm, well, that's why you gotta get real Cubans.|
Another scream rents the air.
|In a hospital room, Neil lies in a bed, his face obscured with bandages and|
an IV line connected to him. Danielle is there fussing with the remains of a
hospital meal on a tray. George enters.
Danielle walks away with a water jug from Neil's table. She goes to a sink in
the corner as George speaks.
|admire your skills, Mr Peanut.|
Danielle brings back the jug.
made for you.
George flourishes a doorkey before Danielle.
|Danielle takes the jug and leaves the room. Dejectedly, George wanders toward|
|the door. As he moves, Neil whispers to him.|
|George purses his lips and nods ruefully. He stands up and leaves, closing|
|the door behind him. There is a brief pause, then the door opens a few inches|
|and George's hand reaches back inside the room, takes hold of the IV line and|
|tugs it sharply, breaking it free of the IV bag,and drops it. Then the hand|
is withdrawn and the door closes again.
|Elaine sits in an aisle seat in a 747, reading a Let's Go Tunisia book. She|
listens as a voice comes over the tannoy.
|Smiling, Elaine puts down her book to watch the movie. Someone from a seat|
beside her wants to get out.

George is prepared to give his speech at the Yankees meeting.

|Jerry removes his coat, to reveal he's wearing the crested jacket from the|
Friars Club.

attire.

Kramer has a bowl on the counter and fetches a box of cereal.

butter and jelly. (clicks tongue)
Kramer leaves and closes the door behind him.
|It's late at night, and her's is the only light on in the building. Elaine|
|sits at a computer, typing away at the keyboard. She's surrounded by piles of|
|paperwork, which she rummages through. She sighs, frustrated at being saddled|
with all this work.
|It's night, and Jerry lies in bed asleep. Kramer enters the room quietly and|
sits on the edge of Jerry's bed.
|Jerry walks over to Elaine, who is working at her computer. She has a|
sandwich and a diet soda on her desk.

|Jerry pulls a face, helps himself to a sandwich and sits down, as Elaine|
turns to him.

Bob stands at the urinal. Jerry opens the door and enters the room. He sees
|Bob, and wonders about something. Jerry slowly crosses the room until he's|
standing about three feet behind Bob.
|Bob finishes what he has to do, and half-turns to find Jerry behind him.|
|Jerry feigns innocence, Bob completes his zipping up whilst faced away from|
Jerry.
Jerry and Bob give embarrassed acknowledgement smiles.
Elaine types away at her computer. Jerry enters.
Elaine goes back to work. Jerry leaves.
|Jerry sits, reading a paper, at the table. There is a knock at the door.|
The door slowly opens wide enough for George to lean into the room. He's
|smiling, looks at Jerry and raises his eyebrows quizzically. Jerry smiles|
back.
|you and Hallie want, we could try and hold it, may...|
Jerry reenters looking confused.
Kramer has closed his eyes and fallen asleep while leaning on the counter in
Jerry's kitchen.
|Bob is working at his desk, with his back to the door. Elaine arrives and|
stands in the doorway.
|Bob continues to muse over some of the work in front of him, giving no sign|
of knowing Elaine is there.
Bob still doesn't react to Elaine. Elaine takes a couple of steps into Bob's
|office, and decides to try a different tactic.|
|As Elaine speaks, Peterman walks past the open door. Hearing Elaine's voice,|
his attention is caught. He stops to listen.
Bob continues to be oblivious to Elaine. Elaine pulls a pensive face and
leaves.
|George, Susan and Hallie sit in a box overlooking the stage (just like the|
two guys in the Muppets). There's an empty seat beside Hallie. George is
making small talk.
Lively music begins and the Flying Sandos Brothers bound onto the stage to
applause from the auditorium. Jerry and his friends all join in.
|Kramer sits on his couch with Connie, who is playfully toying with the collar|
on his shirt.
|The Sandos Brothers are on stage performing a juggling act with glasses,|
trays and bottle. It ends with them pouring drinks and toasting the audience.
The audience applaud appreciatively.
The Sandos Brothers launch into the next part of their act. One brother
|climbs onto the shoulders of another and is carried to the edge of the stage,|
|where he climbs from the shoulders into the box containing Jerry, George,|
Susan and Hallie. The audience applaud.

The rest of the audience cheer and clap.
|Jerry shrugs out of the jacket, to the applause of friends and audience. He|
hands it to the Sandos Brother.
Agrabah! And we make it disappear.
|As he finishes his speech, he tosses the jacket out of the box and into the|
|audience. The audience clap, as do George, Susan and Hallie. Jerry peers over|
|the edge of the box, after the jacket.|
|Connie lies on the couch, underneath Kramer. She strokes the side of his head|
with her fingers.
|Connie lifts Kramer's head and looks at his face, which is completely slack|
and expressionless.
|Panicky, Connie tries again to lift Kramer enough to get out, but is unable|
to move his inert bulk. She reaches across to the table and grabs the handset
|of the phone. Quickly, she dials a number and puts the phone to her ear.|
|dropped dead on top of me. (listens) I can't call the cops, 'cos Joey might|
find out. (listens) I can't. I'm stuck. You gotta help me.
Jerry leads George and the girls up to a door marked 'Dressing Room 3'.
|Jerry knocks on the door. It's opened after a second, by one of the Sandos|
|Brothers who looks at Jerry, questioningly.|
Jerry looks past to where another couple of Sandos Brother are still
changing.
The Sandos Brother at the door turns to the other two an rattles off a
question in some foreign language. The other two speak to each other and
|reply to the question, also in a foreign tongue, but clearly they don't know|
anything.
George doesn't look like the prospect of coffee alone with Susan is something
he relishes.
|George and Susan sit either side of a table, with coffee. There's a definite|
lack of sparkling conversation. George forces a smile at Susan. There's a
|long pause, broken only by Susan sighing. George finally thinks of something|
to say.
The waitress pulls the check from her pocket and puts it on the table for
George.
|As Jerry walks up to his door, Kramer's door opens and two guys emerge|
carrying a large body-shaped object wrapped in fabric. They carry it away
down the hall.
Jerry shakes his head at Kramer's antics as he enters his apartment.
It is night. A large black car squeals to a stop beside the river. The two
guys we just saw leave Kramer's apartment climb out of the car. They open the
trunk and haul out the wrapped object they were carrying. They lug it to the
|rail at the edge of the road, and heave it over the edge. It splashes into|
the river and begins to sink. The two guys quickly close the trunk of the car
and climb back in.
|The object sinks down into the water. Suddenly, the contents begin to squirm|
and jump. The outline of a human body can be seen within the fabric. The top
|of the wrappings opens and Kramer emerges. He looks around, wide-eyed, and|
|would scream with shock, were he not underwater. He kicks his legs and swims|
toward the surface.
|Kramer breaks the surface with a splutter. He looks round, panicky and|
confused.
|Kramer looks to one side, where he sees a large ferry bearing down on him. He|
turns and begins swimming away from the vessel.
|Elaine is working away, when Peterman enters behind her. He's carrying a|
couple of bits of card.
|little early, so you both can get ready.|
Elaine looks confused. Peterman begins to leave.
word you said.
Elaine realises what Peterman overheard.
|Jerry is on the phone, as George enters.|
|George) Well, that was the Friars Club. D'you think they're gonna let a|
jacket-stealer join? I don't think so! They're gonna charge me eight hundred
|dollars for the jacket, and I gotta deal with Pat Cooper!|
Jerry stalks about as George sits on the couch.
|in a SACK!! I think she drugged me, but she's a murderer and I'm calling the|
cops.
have me!
|Kramer moves to leave, but walks into the door with a loud thud.|
Kramer stomps away to his own apartment.
Jerry and George stand where they dealt with the maitre d' on their previous
|visit. As they wait, they're people-watching.|
|you put a suit on, and you walk right out. What are you some sort of an|
idiot?
Pat Cooper walks away from the guys. Jerry motions for George to leave with
him. George looks round and sees something.
|Over at one of the tables, the Sandos Brother who took Jerry's jacket is|
entertaining some other guests. He's wearing a familiar crested jacket.
|Jerry and George walk into the Friars Club, but within a couple of strides|
they are faced with the maitre d'.
|The maitre d' shepherds Jerry and George out of the door, despite their|
continuing protests.
Jerry and George are ejected from the Friars Club.
|Elaine and Bob sit in the same box used by Jerry, George, Susan and Hallie.|
Elaine looks distinctly unenthused at the prospect of spending the evening
with Bob. Bob looks delighted to be ensconced with Elaine.
Bob slips one hand round the back of Elaine's seat and leans slightly toward
her.
|Elaine looks at Bob, wondering what he's talking about. Bob dives across at|
|Elaine, putting his arms round her and his face on her chest.|
|Bob stands for a few seconds, with Elaine glaring at him. Then he dives in|
for another go. Elaine struggles with him again.
Get a hold of yourself!
|Bob slowly gets to his feet. Elaine glares at him, and Bob shamefacedly|
shuffles away out of the box.
Jerry and George come round a corner in a dingy corridor at the theatre.
Along the corridor comes the Sandos Brother who took Jerry's jacket. He has a
jacket slung over one shoulder. Jerry and George collide with him.
Jerry grabs hold of the jacket and begins a tug-of-war with it. George joins
|in, trying to release the grip of the Sandos Brother. The door to 'Dressing|
Room 3' opens and Hallie emerges and watches the struggle.
Jerry and George succeed in taking the jacket. The Sandos Brother runs away
|down the corridor, shouting.|
Hallie reaches inside the door of Dressing Room 3 and pulls out a jacket on a
hanger.
|Hallie walks away, leaving George's Gatsby ambitions in tatters.|
Elaine sits alone in the box. Something on the floor catches her eye. It's
|Bob's hearing-aid earpiece. Elaine picks it up, and it occurs to her that she|
has the opportunity she wanted. She wipes the earpiece on the lapel of her
jacket and carefully slips it over her ear. Elaine cocks her head on one
|side, listening to see if it makes a difference.|
|Jerry and George walk along backstage. Jerry has his jacket, and George is|
|carrying the Sandos Brother's jacket, looking sullen.|
|Behind Jerry and George, the Flying Sandos Brothers appear. They look over|
toward Jerry and George.
The Sandos Brothers set off running after Jerry and George. George hurriedly
|puts the jacket down on a table, as he and Jerry begin to hasten.|
|Jerry and George run away, as the Sandos Brothers advance.|
George is on the lead as he and Jerry reach a door marked 'Emergency Exit.
Alarm will sound'. George pushes the door open and he and Jerry dart through.
|As they do, a loud alarm bell begins to ring.|
|Elaine is sitting wearing the earpiece when the alarm sounds. Obviously, the|
|earpiece works, as Elaine spasms in pain at the ringing. She clutches her|
|hands to her ears and jerks off her seat, falling out of sight onto the floor|
of the box.
|Kramer stands outside the door to an apartment, flanked by two other guys.|
|One of the guys knocks at the door. After a few seconds, it is opened by|
Connie.
Connie goes back into her apartment.
She buzzes him up.
|Just as he walks into the building, we see the Lopper is actually Slippery Pete carrying a car battery by it's wires.|

Elaine enters.
Queens)
|George has parked his car on the street, and gets out. An elderly guy is on the|
porch of his house and recognises George.
Lobby)
Kramer is leading Jerry and Elaine on a tour of the Alex. There are a few
customers scattered about and a bored attendant behind the counter. Elaine has a
big bucket of popcorn.

Elaine grabs Jerry by the arm and leads him toward the auditorium.
|'em, that's all. (puts an arm round Lloyd's shoulder) Not crazy.|
Auditorium)
Jerry and Elaine sit in the front row of seats. Elaine is eating popcorn.
Seeing him made me feel very uncomfortable.
|The lights go down, and music is heard as the show begins. Jerry and Elaine lean|
back in their seats to be able to see the screen

Pop comes out momentarily.
|Pop, put down the wrench, Pop.|
Auditorium)
|Kramer and Lloyd sits side by side in the special seats, watching Spartacus.|
They're smiling happily.
Jerry and Elaine lean uncomfortably back in their front-row seats. They're both
|eating popcorn. Elaine drops a piece onto her blouse, where it rests next to a|
|fancy button. She retrieves the corn, and dislodges the button without noticing.|
The button falls to the floor where it rests among other detritus.
George is driving along the road in his Le Baron. Over the usual engine noise
|can be heard a metallic rasping, grinding noise. George listens for a few|
|moments, wondering where it's coming from. Then he looks concerned, then angry.|
Lobby)
|Kramer and Jerry stand in the lobby. Kramer smoking his pipe, Jerry massaging|
his neck. Lloyd wanders over to join them.
|Elaine enters. In the absence of the button she lost in the auditorium, her|
|blouse is open to below her breasts, and everything's in the shop window. Not|
that she knows it.
Elaine is suffering with her neck. She rolls her head back and feels the back of
her neck with her hand.
|Elaine stretches her back and neck, at the same time pushing her upperworks into|
greater prominence.
|bath. It was nice to see you again, Lloyd.|
Elaine leaves. Kramer and Lloyd both stare after her.
|Elaine walks down the sidewalk, her blouse still open. A florist is using a hose|
|to wash down the sidewalk in front of his store. Elaine carefully steps by,|
picking her way past. The florist also stares at Elaine's exposure.
A cop stands a little further down the street. Elaine approaches him.
|hose? I mean, he's flooding the sidewalk. It's a waste of water. Couldn't he|
just use a broom?
The cop stares at Elaine's breasts the whole time she's talking.
|Elaine looks confused about his attitude. She glances down, and notices her|
|blouse wide open. She quickly pulls her coat closed, to hide her embarrassment,|
and hurries away.
Kramer is handing Jerry a pair of spectacles.
|purpose. Ooh yeah, that's very nice. Very nice.|
|George leans on the counter by the cash register, behind which sits Ruthie|
Cohen.
|and uh, so if you have a twenty in there with big lips on it... well, (smiles)|
that's mine. Would you mind opening up the register?
Lloyd approaches the register to pay for something. The cashier rings up
George's purchase.
George goes round to the other side of the register and picks up all the
|twenty-dollar bills. He shuffles through them, examining them for doodles.|
Think I'm gonna forget about this? I haven't forgotten about this. I don't
forget that easily!
|Jerry is reading a newspaper, and holding it in such a way as to conceal his|
face.
|Jerry folds over the top half of the paper, in order to see his visitor. He also|
reveals to all that he is wearing the spectacles Kramer gave him earlier.
|around, chewing gum, huh? Mmm, mmm, yeah. So uh, you know, Lloyd, he thinks he|
can get more of this.
Jerry makes a show of removing his glasses and cleaning them.

Jerry puts his glasses back on.
ba-boom-ba-ba-ba-boom-ba.
|They continue to chew on the gum. Lloyd seemingly happily, Jerry clearly not|
|liking it, and Kramer not liking it, but unwilling to show it to Lloyd.|
George and Deena sit on a bench.
here!! Don't gallop away!!
|George runs away, yelling after the retreating Ruthie Cohen.|
Jerry and George sit in a booth. There's a different cashier on duty.
any high-flying cashier's been throwing twenty dollar bills around with big
lips.
Elaine enters.
Lobby)
Kramer greets a small elderly gent.
|soon. Listen, could you keep an eye on the place? I wanna go out and get some|
|paraffin wax, and bring out the lustre of this vintage countertop.|
Kramer leaves. Haarwood begins to rummage through the contents of the box. After
|a few seconds, he finds something. He lifts it out for a closer look. It's the|
button Elaine dropped earlier.
Street Outside Alex)
George starts his car. It's still making unhealthy noises.
|As he sits with the engine running, a car pulls up in the street behind him. The|
driver sounds the horn at George as he sits in his parking spot.
|The horn sounds several more times, impatiently. George has had enough. He|
climbs out of his car.
George stalks round his car and up to the driver's window of the car sounding
its horn.
|meter, and I'm not budging til you admit you stole my twenty dollars. (smug)|
|Huh-hu-hur, you're not so tough when you're not on your horse, are you Ruthie?|
The reflection of leaping flames can be seen in Ruthie's window. George dashes
off back to his car.
|George grabs the broom from the florist, and begins beating at the flames with|
|no effect. After a few seconds, the broom is alight.|
The whole front of George's car is burnt out. The plastic body parts have melted
|away. The hood is wide open, showing the devastation within. George stands,|
holding the charred remnants of the broom. He's staring catatonically at the
damage. Kramer walks up and does a double-take at the sight.
Lobby)
Jerry is waiting. He's wearing the glasses from earlier.
Jerry puts them on. The lenses are much stronger than the first pair - they're
|like bottle-bottoms. He stares through them, his eyes magnified hugely. It's|
obvious he can't see at all clearly.
if you know what I mean.
They chuckle.
|The attendant looks to the machine, which contains one hotdog. The appearance of|
|the article is not pleasant. It's wrinkled, shriveled, and generally|
disgusting.
Mmm. It's a perfectly sane food to eat. (he takes another bite)
|As he chews, it begins to be apparent that all is not as it should be with the|
hotdog.
|gotta get, some air.|
|Kramer stumbles toward the exit, bits of half-chewed hotdog falling from his|
mouth.
|Kramer walks stiffly along the sidewalk. He's breathing heavily, and loosening|
|his collar. He walks by the florist, who is brushing the sidewalk again. As|
|Kramer passes George's car, his struggle with the rancid hotdog ends with the|
|hotdog triumphant, and he leans into the gutter behind the Le Baron and vomits|
|copiously. The florist looks rueful, leans his broom against his door, and|
|fetches his hose, whilst Kramer continues his refunding.|
Later)
The florist is hosing away the traces of Kramer's visit. Elaine walks up to him.
|The florist turns to see who's shouting. As he does, he raises the nozzle of his|
|hose, so instead of hosing the sidewalk, he sprays Elaine.|
The florist notices what he's done and turns off the hose.
Lobby)
|Jerry sits beside Kramer, who still looks unwell. Lloyd stands comforting|
|Kramer. Elaine enters. She has removed her jacket, and is wearing a wringing wet|
t-shirt.

|Jerry hears his name called and turns his head, but all he can see are blurry|

Jerry and Lloyd have reached Chinatown. Lloyd parks the car.
Jerry digs his wallet out of his pocket. He opens it and extracts a bill. He
|peers at it, trying to work out what denomination it is, but the glasses are|
still too strong.
George and Deena walk along together.
|Jerry sits waiting. Lloyd gets in. He has a stack of six boxes, which he hands|
to Jerry.
The room is festooned with props and costumes from old movies.

wait a minute. Lemme get a pack of gum here.
|He gets his wallet from under the cape, and goes to the window of a kiosk.|
I owe that cashier an apology.
Deena is walking toward George and Kramer. She sees George in his costume and
jumps to the obvious conclusion.
Lobby)
|Kramer stands behind the counter, upon which Elaine leans. Mr Haarwood enters.|
|Lloyd and Kramer go away to the side of the lobby, where they go into a quiet|
|conversation. Elaine is peering over at Mr Haarwood, and in particular at the|
button he's wearing on his cravat.
|Elaine moves very close to Mr Haarwood, and reaches under his chin to remove the|
button.
Kramer and Lloyd are both staring over at the sight of Elaine tickling Mr
|Haarwood under the chin, giggling, apparently flirting.|

Scene cuts to Tim Whatley's dental office.
Jerry sits down and browses through the magazine on the table and
discovers Tim has Penthouse magazines for patients to read.
Scene then switches to Jerry's apartment. Elaine is on the phone.
..hemmm! blond guy who's always at the exercycle at the health

Hank leaves as she's ready to make her move. Elaine turns to try to find
out where he could be and stops when she takes notice of Jimmy.
Whatley puts the suction device in Kramer's mouth and loud suctions sounds
are heard.

Kramer reaches for a glass of water and drinks but manages to have it
spill out on to the floor
Scene cuts then comes back with paramedics and Jimmy on a stretcher.
Paramedic (missing a few words) ......was gonna be in traction.
Kramer is seen running down the street with his vertical lift shoes. He's
trying to hail a cab.
|The man is looking him up and down, noticing the shoes and the slurred|
speech.

Deensfrei Yes ! Splendid. That's a great idea.

|In a sporting goods store, George tries to make a sale. He is putting on|
the shoes.

Kramer. What!!!
Scene cuts back to Tim Whatley's dental office. Jerry is sitting in the

Cuts to Yankee Stadium. George is sitting at his desk eating Kam Pau
chicken.
|thanks for calling back. No , no , no still got the shoes, still|
got the shoes. Lots of them. This is.. beautiful athletic gear.

You know George I've been your biggest supporter around here
and thats why I was so disappointed to hear that you been pilfering
the equipment.
Cheese again and she forgot the fancy mustard. I told her I like
that fancy mustard. You could put that fancy mustard on a shoe and
it would taste pretty good to me. oh! she made it up with a cupcake

Elaine and Jerry wait by the elevator. Jerry is speaking to the

Julio walks away as the elevator arrives. Jerry and Elaine step aboard.

|of the kiss hello, then I think I could see the value in it a little better.|
|Jerry holds up his hands, indicating he wants a few seconds to prepare.|
|He goes to the refrigerator, and indicates Elaine should let Wendy inside.|
Elaine opens the door and Wendy enters.
|Jerry has the door of the fridge open, and his head is inside the|
appliance.
|Jerry starts to withdraw his head from the fridge, and Wendy is poised|
|for the kiss hello. But, just as he turns to face her, he opens the freezer|
compartment and the door blocks her approach. Wendy walks away to the couch.
|Jerry peers around the edge of the door, to see if the coast is clear.|
Finding

Kramer has covered one wall of the lobby with photographs of the
tenants. They're all labeled with the appropriate name in magic marker. Kramer
is just completing Jerry's name underneath the Polaroid he took earlier. Jerry

The elevator opens and a guy (Steve) steps out. He points to Kramer.
|Kramer turns to the wall of pictures, searches around for the face and|
then
points back. Steve makes his way to the door as Kramer speaks.
A woman (Mary) has entered from the street. She stands behind Jerry and
Looks through Kramer's gallery of tenants.
|Mary leans across and gives Jerry a quick kiss on the cheek, then makes|
her way toward the door. Elaine is giggling gleefully at Jerry's discomfiture.
|Jerry and Elaine enter. Jerry mad, and Elaine still giggling.|
|couldn't! (listens) Alright, I will. (listens) Okay, bye.|
|Jerry hangs up the phone, and turns to Elaine.|
Jerry is collecting his mail from his mailbox. A woman (Joan) enters
And immediately goes for the kiss hello. She's friendly and overfamiliar.
|The elevator comes down, the door opens and another woman (Louise)|
|emerges, with a big friendly smile for Jerry.|
Louise walks on and the unhappy Jerry enters the elevator.
Jerry has just arrived with his mail. The door opens and Kramer darts
into the room.
|Richard Dawson down there now. And every person I see engages me in this long,|
|boring, tedious, conversation. I can't even get out of the building!|
Pay interest on fifty dollars he was supposed to give my mother in

the consequences are.
|As Jerry reaches the end of his emphatic declaration, Kramer takes|
|Jerry's head in his hands, leans in and plants a big kiss right on Jerry's lips.|
|Halfway through the kiss, the door opens and George half-enters. Kramer|
|releases Jerry, who stands bug-eyed with shock. George stands silently in the doorway,|
|he looks from Jerry to Kramer, with a thoughtful expression. Biting his lips,|
George slowly backs out of the door and closes it behind him.
|George enters, and the receptionist spots him.|
George gives an exaggerated wink.
Wendy driving into New York at night with Elaine as passenger. Elaine
|is wearing much of her ski gear - woolly hat, with goggles on top of her head, and|
there are ski poles on the back seat.
Wendy and Elaine share a laugh. Wendy then starts to pull the car over
to the side of the road.
|Way around Central Park West, back to Columbus, you know it's all one|
way...
Elaine struggles along the sidewalk at night with her ski gear in her
|arms. She's not finding it easy fighting with the uncomfortable bulk of skis,|
|poles, boots, etc.. Eventually she drops the boots and, rather than pick them|
|up, simply kicks them along in front of her.|
Jerry and Elaine walk together.
Jerry enters his building. Mary spots him from across the lobby and
closes for a kiss hello.
Jerry backs away from the kiss with so much effort that he's up against
The mailboxes.
It's nothing personal....
Mary looks upset by Jerry's outburst.
I'm sorry.
|The door to the street opens and Louise enters, also friendly and|
aiming for the kiss hello.
Hello thing anymore. (continues backing away) I'm sorry. I just can't do it.
|It's nothing personal, it's just I'm not really able to do it and uh, I'm|
sorry.
Jerry backs into the elevator.
Jerry answers the phone.
|In Florida, Helen is on the phone and Morty is still working out|
figures with a pad and a calculator.
For fifty-three years...
Jerry and Kramer emerge from their apartments.
They walk together down the hall.
The elevator doors open and Jerry and Kramer come out. Something on the
Wall opposite catches Jerry's eye.
The photograph has been crudely vandalised with a magic marker.
|'Grade-A Dork' has been written on the forehead, whiskers, spots, horns and a wormlike|
tongue added and teeth blacked out.
Behind Kramer a guy (Jack) has entered the building. Jack walks up
behind Kramer and slaps him on the shoulder in a friendly fashion.
Jack gives Jerry an unfriendly look and walks to the elevator without
|replying. Julio comes out of the elevator, and Jerry walks over to ask him|
something.
maybe I'll get to it someday. After I take care of the people who're civil to each
other.
Julio stalks away. Jerry swings to give Kramer a look.
Jerry is talking with a nurse on the porch.

Is that it? You're a delicate genius!

|Jerry and Buddy sit on the bench, reminiscing.|
|Hundred dollars, and told him to give fifty to his sister. His sister? Why I|
tell you he shoulda give it to me for all the bottles he took!
|Just then, uncle Leo strolls up the path to the nursing home. Jerry|
spots his arrival.
(indicates Buddy) You remember Buddy. He just told me quite a story about you and
Grandpa at the track.
|Leo's caught out, and looks worried.|
|Jerry enters from the street. Steve is in the lobby, collecting his|
mail. Jerry decides to be friendly.
|Steve turns to Jerry, gives him a disdainful look, and turns away|
again. Another guy (Jeff) approaches from within the building. Jerry tries the
friendly approach again.
Jeff completely blanks Jerry and goes to get his mail. Jerry spots Mary
|over by Kramer's gallery wall, and walks across to her.|
just get out of this building? (angry) Nobody wants you here. Nobody!
|Jerry looks downcast. Mary walks over to the mailboxes, where she|
greets Jeff and Steve.
|The three of them exit together chatting happily, watched by a rueful|
Jerry. Jerry looks at his photo on the wall and adjusts it so it's straight.
|Then Jerry notices the elevator is about to go up, so he asks a favour of the|
occupant as
he crosses the lobby.
|But Paul makes no move to hold the door, which shuts in Jerry's face.|
|Jerry, wearing a bathrobe and with a towel round his neck, knocks at|
|Kramer's door. Kramer takes a quick peek through the peephole, then opens the|
door.

apartment.

An attractive redheaded woman comes along the hallway. Kramer greets

What's amazing to me about the library is it's a place where you go in you can take
out any book you whant they just give it to you and say bring it back when you're done.
It reminds me of like this pathetic friend that everbody had when they were a little
kid who would let you borrow any of his stuff if you would just be his friend. That's
what the library is. A government funded pathetic friend. And that's why everybody
kinds of bullies the library. I'll bring it back on time ... I'll bring it back late.

|Jerry moves to the kitchen, with George following.|
Jerry gives another look to Kramer. George raises his eyes. Kramer rises and
comes over to the guys.

|(judders and puts his hands to his temples, as if receiving a call on a 'mental|
phone') getting a call here.

Jerry begins mouthing 'I'm not here' and making gestures indicating he doesn't
want to talk to Newman.
|Kramer leans toward Jerry, as if to allow him to use the 'mental phone'. Jerry|
throws his arms up in exasperation.
Jerry has just arrived and has presented Valerie with a floral bouquet.
|Valerie leaves to the kitchen(?). The moment she's gone, Jerry rushes over to|
|the phone. He picks it up to read the list of names on the speed-dial, and finds|
himself promoted to the '01' button.
Wilhelm and some others are sitting around the big table. George is sitting
down. He's wearing an old-fashioned baseball jersey. On the table in front of
|him, he places a large paper bag.|

He wipes strawberry juice from his fingers onto Babe Ruth's jersey.
|He fetches another over-ripe strawberry from the bag, and drops it onto the|

George looks stunned as he realises he's not going to be fired.
|Ruth was nothing more than a fat old man, with little-girl legs. And here's|

|think that nerve disease of his was contagious, do you? Uh, I better take 'em|
off. I'm too important to this team. (removes the pants to reveal his boxers)
Big Stein can't be flopping and twitching.
George is further discomfited by the sight of Steinbrenner in his underwear.

Elaine is talking with the saleswoman.

Gladys comes out behind the counter.
Jerry and Mrs Hamilton sitting on the couch. Mrs Hamilton is pouring out a
couple of glasses of wine.
Mrs Hamilton leans back on the couch beside Jerry. She's sitting uncomfortably
|close to Jerry, and as she speaks she puts an arm along the top of the couch|
|behind Jerry. (To cut it short, this scene plays pretty close to the early|
Dustin Hoffman/Anne Bancroft scenes in The Graduate.)
|Kramer is asleep, but his sleep is fitful. He tosses and turns.|
He reaches over to his bedside table and picks up a photograph. It's of himself
|and Jerry at a previous party, looking happy together.|
|Kramer clutches the photo to his chest, and flops back onto the mattress.|
|Jerry sits on his couch, watching baseball on TV. Steve Koren is commentating.|

Kramer enters.

Jerry clicks.
|George is at a public telephone, wearing the flesh-tone body-stocking and|
looking thoroughly dejected.
|He slaps palms with George, who doesn't look especially pleased by the|
attention. The fan points out George to more fans.
|The fans gather round, making positive noises. George looks resigned to his|
minor celebrity.
|Gladys is behind the counter. Outside the door, Elaine peers in for a second|
|before she moves back out of sight. Then, a be-suited Kramer is pushed into|
|sight. He enters the store, smoking a cigar.|
|looking to open a silver mine in the mountains of Peru and uh, before I invest|
|millions in a lucrative mine, I, I'd like to go a little native. Uh, Get the|
|feel of their condiments, of their unmentionables, you know, the real uh,|
gritty-gritty.
He notices a bowl of chips beside the register and helps himself to some.
Kramer strolls over to a rack and grabs a selection of a half-dozen items. He
then heads for the changing room.
He pulls the curtain shut. The sound of a pricing gun can be heard. The clicking
|goes on for a couple of seconds, and then the gun is dropped. It lands by|
|Kramer's feet and breaks, Kramer then exacerbates his problem by kicking the gun|
as he tries to retrieve it.
George is driving his car in a circle in the parking lot. Trailing behind the
|car, on a rope, is a trophy which bounces and clatters on the tarmac. George is|
|leaning out of the car window, with a megaphone.|

I fear no reprisal. Extension five-one-seven-oh.

|to the changing room, pulls back the curtain and enters.|
|He takes a chip and dips it. As he loads the chip with the dip, a sachet of|

|Kramer leaves. Mrs Hamilton comes over to the counter, takes a chip, dips it|
into the dessicate-laced dip and eats it.
|George stands before Steinbrenner's desk, in his shirt-sleeves, nonchalantly|
eating something. He occasionally shrugs at Steinbrenner's remarks.
|in-excuse-a-bull. You personally insulted me, my staff... I cannot believe that|
|you, body-suit man, could perpetrate such a disloyalty. Breaks my heart to say|
|it... Oh, who am I kidding? I love it. You're fi...|
|George looks expectant, as Steinbrenner reaches this point. Suddenly, Mr Wilhelm|
enters the office.

|here, it's me.|
George stares at Wilhelm in disbelief.

Jerry pulls a disgusted face.
Kramer and Newman move to the door to leave. Newman stops as Jerry speaks to
|him, and Kramer exits to his apartment.|
|year zero, the millennium doesn't begin until the year two-thousand and one.|
|Which would make your party, one year late, and thus, quite lame.|
Newman absorbs the logic of Jerry's argument. His face twitches as he realises
his error.
Newman makes a noise redolent of his frustration - a sort of half-strangulated
nasal squeak. He then waddles away after Kramer.
Valerie and Mrs Hamilton sit on the couch. Mrs Hamilton looks nauseous.
She picks up the phone and pushes a button marked 'Poison Control'.

guy behind the counter.
|Okay, listen guys, I'm gonna be late. (taking her cup of coffee) I'll see|
|you, okay? (begins to walk away)|
|Elaine leaves. Jerry moves to wander out of the store also, when George|
stops him.
|George walks off, pulling an angry face.|
Jerry and George sit in a booth.
|Elaine sits behind her desk, in the big fancy office she gets standing in|
for Peterman as president. Kramer enters.
|Kramer starts to move, and thumps his knee on the underside of the desk. He|
rises and begins to head for the door.
|Morty and Helen sit on the couch, watching TV and doing a crossword,|
|respectively. Jerry enters from the bedroom, carrying a suitcase.|
|George and his parents are seated at the table in the kitchen, eating a meal|
of spaghetti.
George thinks a little and looks hopeful.

Helen looks unconvinced. A spiffily-dressed Frank and Estelle enter the
restaurant and are spotted by George.
|Once again, Kramer and Emily are basking in the afterglow.|
Kramer climbs quickly out of the bed to leave.
|Morty, dressed in exercise gear, emerges from the bedroom. He is carrying|
|the travel gym. He creeps across the room, so as not to wake Jerry, who is|
|asleep on the couch, quietly opens the door and slips outside.|
|Kramer is asleep in his bed, when something wakes him. He can hear a|
thumping and a rattling sound. Kramer turns over and looks across at his
|door, to see the handle turning, as if someone outside were trying to open|
it. A look of horror comes to Kramer's face.
|Outside in the hallway, Morty has his travel gym attached to Kramer's|
|doorknob. As he pulls on the arrangement of cords and pulleys, they in turn|
pull at the doorknob.
|Inside Kramer's apartment, a terrified Kramer pulls the blankets over his|

|A grubby Jerry sits at the table, with Jack hovering over him.|

George is distracted momentarily by Kramer clattering dishes. He gives

and throws up his hands as he walks away.

penis in a chess game. And I'm letting him win.
|scenes with her, and I do it because I'm so addicted to the sex, I'm helpless,|
I'll do anything. So finally Kramer comes in the other day.
|I haven't got the will power to throw out her number. Please, help me. Help|
me.
New scene.
|Elaine, George, Jerry, Kramer and Audrey are at Elaine's apartment.|
|I was the one that encouraged you to do this, you know? Now that you're gonna|
|be a great beauty, let's not forget how this all began. You know, like if you'd|
|listened to your friend, Elaine,|
George faints.
|An undetermined time later, Jerry and Elaine are helping George to his feet.|
|science. Can't stop it, you can't stop it. Can't stop science. Can't be|
|stopped, no way, no how, science just marches--|
New scene.
|Jerry and Kramer are at Jerry's apartment. Kramer is pouring a bowl of cereal,|
Jerry has cracked.
Yeah! (Jerry falls to the floor and starts arranging pieces) Look at you!
|Look at what you've sunk to! Look at what you've become! Look in the mirror,|
|cause you need help, Jerry. You need help, because I can't stand by and do it|
anymore. It's turning my stomach! I can't stand around here watching you
destroy yourself. It's eating me up inside!
|Kramer storms out, then storms back in to grab the box of cereal and the bowl,|
then storms out again.
New scene.
|George and Audrey are at the coffee shop, Audrey is talking about her nose,|
George is trying not to look at it.
|George (removing his glasses) You know, Hawaii could be a little tricky right|
|now, there's a lot of high pressure winds down there this time of year, there's|
|a lot of debris constantly flying around. Wood, and uh, lava, pretty dangerous.|
|right now. I get those FAA reports directly. My uncle sends them to me, he|
|used to be a pilot, so. Big investigation in the, uh, what's the word there,|
|uh, offing. It's in the offing. But, you know, you shouldn't let that stop you|
from going. You could go. I don't mind.
New scene.
Jerry is rehearsing with Isabel.
Cut to the table where a slightly translucent Jerry's brain is playing chess
with a similarly visible Jerry's penis.
|with that for an hour to make me happy? You're so selfish. Give me one hour,|
|then I will take over, you will not have to think for the rest of the night.|
|like for me? Do you care? No, you don't care. So long as you get to do|
whatever it is you do. You disgust me.
New scene.
Elaine and Kramer are outside the landlord's apartment.
|anyone, but I suppose I can make an exception in your case. The closet's this|
way.
|Kramer enters after Elaine, banging his pipe on the door frame.|
New scene.
|Jerry's Brain and Penis are still playing chess, Jerry's Brain appears to have|
the upper hand.
power... You haven't seen the last of me. I'll be back. You're nothing
without me. Nothing!
Jerry's Penis disappears with an audible pop.
Isabel checks the script with a puzzled look on her face.
|Back to Elaine, Kramer and the landlord at Albert Pepper's apartment.|
|around about two years ago, looked a lot like you, Professor. Could have been|
|your mother. What was her name again? Carter? Kramer! That's it, Babs|
|Kramer. Nasty woman, many a night I had to throw her out on the street, drunken|
stumblebum.
|can. Her big fat stomach hanging out, orthopedic hose up to her knees,|
|screaming down the hall, "Come back to bed, Albert, you big hairy ape, and bring|
back that box of Danish!"
|Throughout the landlord's narrative, Kramer becomes more and more agitated.|
|Finally, he grabs the pipe out of his mouth.|
New scene.
The four are at their usual booth at the coffee shop.
Kramer shows off the fruits of their labor; he's wearing the jacket. Audrey
|walks in, her nose has been repaired and she's absolutely beautiful.|
proportion with the rest of her face. She's breathtaking! Who would have
though she's like--
|The technical term for a nose job is rhinoplasty. Rhino, okay? Do we really|
need to insult the person at this particular moment of their lives? They know
|they have a big nose, that's why they're coming in. Do they really need the|
abuse of being compared to a rhinoceros on top of everything else? When someone
|goes in for a hair transplant, they don't go, "We're going to perform a|
|cue-ballectomy on you, Mr. Johnson. We're going to attempt to remove the|
skinheadia of your chrome-domus which is the technical term."
|Every time somebody recommends a doctor, he's always the best. "Oh, is he good?" "Oh, he's the best. This guy's the best." They can't all be the best.|
|There can't be this many bests. Someone's graduating at the bottom of these classes, where are these doctors? Is somewhere, someone saying to their friend, "You should see my doctor, he's the worst. Oh yeah, he's the worst, he's the absolute worst there is. Whatever you've got, it'll be worse after you see him.|
|He's just, he's a butcher. The man's a butcher."? And then there's always that, "Make sure that you tell him that, you know, you know me." Why? What's the difference? He's a doctor. What is it, "Oh, you know Bob! Okay, I'll give you the real medicine. Everybody else, I'm giving Tic-Tacs."|
How could you ever enjoy a meal like that? I'd constantly be feeling around
with my lips and my tongue.
|these people are all over the place. You never know who's crazy, I could be one|
of these people.
like I don't deserve it so I talk. It stops me from enjoying it. There's
nothing to eat in here.
|therapist. There's a big difference. She uses the ultrasound, it's a real|
|medical procedure. In fact, if you get a doctor's note, it's covered by|
insurance.
|please? And Elaine, you'll be seeing Julianna, and George, you'll be with|
Raymond.
George gets up cautiously and walks with Raymond.
George is on the table getting a massage from Raymond. George appears extremely
uncomfortable.
that way.
|George loosens his pants, Raymond grabs them and yanks then down his hips then|
starts massaging his lower back.
|George gets up to remove his pants, he looks over and sees Raymond rubbing his|
|hands with oil. Nervous, George pulls his pants down and climbs back on the|
|table. As soon as Raymond touches his leg, George becomes rigid with|
discomfort.
|Elaine is in the waiting room, George walks out very slowly, he appears|
positively shell-shocked.
|George walks right out the door, ignoring Elaine.|
|Jerry's apartment, Jerry is on the phone.|
|Thursday? And Friday? Oh boy. Okay, thanks anyway.|
George enters acting nervous.
Holyfield. He's a good friend of one of my patients. He's got a hell of a
|body, doesn't he?|
|George, who is staring intently at the Holyfield poster) George?|
|Jerry and Elaine are at Jerry's apartment, Jerry is on the phone.|
|to sit down on the couch, but Elaine is too close to the end and he has to|
squeeze in between her and the arm to sit down) Can I at least just talk to her
|so I can apologize? Forget it. (Hangs up) I can't believe this, I make one|
innocent comment about some lunatic in Pennsylvania and I'm cut off. This woman
is insane. (Looks at Elaine for a moment) What's with you?
|sitting in there, you know. And I start banging on the table, you know, to uh,|
|look up, you know, Like I'm sitting there you know and uh, *bang* (slams the|
|table) You know, *bang* He wouldn't move. So then I start doing these yelping|
|noises. Like, *yip* (high pitched yelping noises) *yip*. No reaction because|
|the guy is so focused, you see, he can just block out anything that's going on|
|around him. See, that's how he played baseball. He dunks like he hits.|
(George stretches out his arms in a ballet motion) They called me a Mary. So I
|chased them, and I tripped and I fell.|
|motion) What is that? No really, what is that?|
|George heads for the bathroom, the phone rings, Kramer answers it, Jerry grabs|
it from him.

investigation for insurance fraud.
|should have heard him. Three notes, how stupid was that? We never should have|
got three notes.

Kramer leaves.
Jerry and George are at Roy's office.

Julianna then runs down the hall.

Jerry spots Kramer through the window.
Maybe it's time you got as different hobby.
Kramer enters and sits at the booth.
(again) *yip* (another high pitched yelping sound) *yip* See? I told you.
|What causes homophobia? What is it that makes a heterosexual man worry? I think it's because men know that deep down we have weak sales resistance. We're constantly buying shoes that hurt us, pants that don't fit right. Men think, "Obviously I can be talked into anything. What if I accidentally wander into some sort of homosexual store, thinking it's a shoe store, and the salesman goes, 'Just hold this guy's hand, walk around the store a little bit, see how you feel. No obligation, no pressure, just try it. Would you like to see him in a sandal?'"|

|*good*! I *really* feel good. The strange thing is, I mean, I|
haven't even met the woman yet.
|I dunno, you take them for a walk and you get a cup of coffee and|
it's supposed to make them feel good.

The idea behind the tuxedo is the woman's point of view that men are all the
|same, so we might as well dress them that way. That's why a wedding is like|
|the joining together of a beautiful glowing bride, and some guy. The tuxedo|
is a wedding safety device created by women because they know that men are
|undependable. So in case the groom chickens out, everybody just takes one|
step over and she marries the next guy. That's why the wedding vow isn't 'do
|you take Bill Simpson', its 'do you take this man'.|

that there is big big trouble for that clown

|How do you even start into being a clown, how do you know that you want to|

actually easier to become a clown than having the proper alterations done.

is really just a very annoying person. You're in the back seat of this guys

They see the real clown singing and realize that they are talking to Crazy
Joe. They run away.
people with tickets can get through.
Kramer slides in.
|The show starts, everyone claps except Elaine and Jerry who look very|
frightened.
|they've got those little opera glasses, you know, do you really need|
|binoculars, I mean how big do these people have to get before you can spot|
|'em. These opera kids they're going two-fifty, two-eighty, three-twenty-five, they're wearing big white woolly vests, the women have|
|like the breastplates, the bullet hats with the horn coming out. If you|
|can't pick these people out, forget opera, think about optometry, maybe that's more you're thing.|
|handkerchiefs. I mean, they open it up, blow their nose in it, and then put it back|
|in their pockets with their other valuables. Wallet, keys, mucous, yup, I've got|
everything. Is it because men can't give birth that they're just proud of anything
that comes out of us? We actually have a monogram sewn on to them. What is the
source of pride here? We actually have it sticking out of the breast pocket of our
jacket. "I have a snot rag."
|We see a sad-looking George staring out at the ocean. Then cut to the office of Mr.Lippman, where Elaine and Mr. Lippman are toasting in champagne.|
something!

Cut to G's car

Cut to George's parents' house
|Oh, I'll have the chicken salad on rye, my usual, you know what I get, darlin'. ( Turns to the Gang ) So, let's see, I had a little conversation today with Mr Don Mattingly - he's the first base man.

|someone is thin, single and neat people assume they are gay because that|
|is a stereotype. They normally don't think of gay people as fat, sloppy|
|and married. Although I'm sure there are, I don't want to perpetuate|
the stereotype. I'm sure they are the minority though within the gay

|people say to them "Y'know Joe, I enjoy being gay with you but I think|

|At parking lots now they have these 'compact car only' spots, isn't that|
discrimination against the size of your car? If I want my ass hanging out of
|the back of my parking spot, that's my business. There are people out there|

first moment where I'd take it off and see that look of disappointment on her
face.
Elaine moves the rear view mirror so she can check out her sunglasses and this
causes George to swerve and hit something.
Cut back to Kramer and Jerry at Jerry's apartment.
|Cut back to Elaine and George in Jerry's car, the car is now making a clanking|
noise.
no idea they're going on. Wanna see me make a right turn from the left lane?
Watch this.
|it's a sickness. My father never paid for parking; my mother, my brother,|
nobody. We can't do it.
|like going to a prostitute. Why should I pay, when if I apply myself, maybe I|
could get it for free? (he hears a horn honking) What? What do you want? Go

that's the key.

|guy. Are you crazy, what are you doing?! Hey! Hey, you're stealing my space!|
|Elaine heads upstairs. Mike honks his horn, George honks his in retaliation.|
|Cut to Jerry's apartment. Jerry is moving chairs, Elaine bursts in.|

bag of chips off the counter)
Elaine (after pouring the shot in the sink while Jerry was distracted and

|So George tries to lose them, and, and, but they were in this really like a|

Kramer walks into Jerry's apartment.

|George) Why is it every time you park a car in this block, everything gets|
disrupted and disjointed?
anybody could just pull into any parking space any way they want. Well I'm
making a stand here. I'm saying *no* to head first parking. I'm not putting up

head first parking.
|An old man and Matthew, the boy who's father owns the 'fat free' frozen yogurt|

you why. because it signals a breakdown in the social order. Chaos. It
reduces us to jungle law.
George begins applauding.
|There it is! (turning to Newman) Alright, here! You wanna try on the hat?!|
Here! Try on the hat!
you completely misunderstood what I said. I meant it in a complementary way. I

Jerry falls over and hides his face in the couch cushion.
|People will kill each other for a parking space in New York because they think,|
|'If I don't get this one, I may never get a space.' You know? 'I'll be|

everyone in New York City knows there's gotta be way more cars than parking
spaces. You see cars driving in New York all hours of the night. It's like

The bad thing about television is that everybody you see on television is
doing something better than what you're doing. Did you ever see anybody on TV
like just sliding off the front of the sofa with potato chip crumbs on their
commercial people - where do they summon this enthusiasm? Have you seen them?
|"We have soda, we have soda, we have soda", jumping, laughing, flying through|
the air - it's a can of soda. Have you ever been standing there and you're
watching TV and you're drinking the exact same product that they're advertising
|right there on TV, and it's like, you know, they're spiking volleyballs,|
|jetskiing, girls in bikinis and I'm standing there - "Maybe I'm putting too much|
ice in mine."
|and she was sort of smiling at me, and I wasn't sure if she wanted me to ask her|
|out, because when women smile at me I don't know what it means. Sometimes I|
interpret it like they're Psychotic or something and I don't know if I'm
|supposed to smile back, I don't know what to do. So I just stood there like -|
remember how Quayle looked when Benson gave him that Kennedy line? - that's what
I looked like.
I tell Lloyd the whole story. He says "So why don't you call her". I says "I
|can't." I couldn't, I couldn't do it right then. For me to ask a woman out I|
gotta get into a mental state like the karate guys before they break the bricks.
So Lloyd calls me a wuss.
|because I think if they hear you chewing on the other end of the phone, it|
makes you sound casual.

doing Saturday night?"

|could be comfortable too, if I had pants like that. I could sit on a porch and|
|wrestle around, and maybe even be part of a real bull session.|
|somehow somewhere men actually talk like that, what does that have to do with|
the pants? Doesn't that bother you?
|pants, pants, pants, pants, pants. What is that supposed to be?|
What's brutal about the date is the scrutiny that you put each other
|through. Because whenever you think about this person in terms of the future,|
|you have to magnify everything about them. You know, like the guy'll be like|
'I don't think her eyebrows are even. Could I look at uneven eyebrows for the
|rest of my life?' And of course the woman's looking at the guy, thinking 'What|
is he looking at? Do I want somebody looking at me like this for the rest of my
life?'

of me.

down a cordless phone. You get mad at somebody on a real phone - "You can't

|taste of the baking soda, and leans over the sink to spit. He puts his hand on|
the counter and knocks Jenna's toothbrush off the edge. The brush falls into the
toilet bowl.
|There is a shot from beneath the water in the toilet, looking up. Jerry's face|
|looking down into the bowl, with an expression of shock and horror.|
|Jerry looks behind him, to see if Jenna has spotted him. He rolls up the sleeve|
|of his dressing gown, grimaces, and plunges his hand into the toilet. He grabs|
|the brush out, drops it on a shelf beside the mirror and immediately begins|
|frantically washing his hands. As he completes this task, he raises his head and|
|finds Jenna has returned. She is standing behind him, smiling as she brushes her|
teeth with the brush he just retrieved from the toilet.

He dumps the machine on the table and sits beside Jerry.

George squeezes the miniature head.
Elaine is calling for Chinese food. The scene flicks from her at home with the
|phone and a menu, to the restaurant owner taking the order.|
Kramer enters. He's smoking a substantial cigar.
|checked it out this morning. Here, take a look. Mile one-fourteen.|
He gets his wallet from his back pocket and shows Jerry a Polaroid snapshot in
it.
|George enters looking anxious, maybe borderline panicky. He stalks about the|
|place, looking for something, frustratedly.|
|Elaine stands on the sidewalk, waiting for someone. She looks up the street and|
sees a Chinese delivery boy approaching with a bag of food. She ducks into the
|entranceway to the apartment building behind her, and then effects to be coming|
out of the building as the delivery boy gets there.
I'll see you.
Elaine walks back towards the door to the building. She expects the boy to
|leave, but he's still suspicious, and waits. Elaine tries the door, but it's|
|locked. She looks, and the boy still waits. Elaine tries the door harder, but it|
|won't yield. She admits defeat and hands the food back, and receives her money.|
The delivery boy walks off.
|George is standing outside a store, looking preoccupied. Jerry emerges from the|
store with a carrier bag full of stuff.
|like a piece of cake, you know? But then I thought, it's morning, I should|
|really have a muffin. I like those chocolate chip ones. Then I figured, well,|
|they're really both cake. So I, uh, I sat on that bench for a little while,|
|twenty minutes or an hour, and then I figured, check and see what you were up|
|to. (a thought occurs to him) Wait a minute, wait a minute. The broad jump! The|
broad jump over the pothole on Eighty-sixth Street!
|George dashes off excitedly. Jerry follows, with somewhat less enthusiasm.|
George is still animatedly leading Jerry along in pursuit of his keys.
here.
He peers about at the road surface for the pothole. He finds a patch of fresh
tarmac.
|Jenna is at the sink in her bathroom, using an electric toothbrush which Jerry|
has bought her. It's loud.
|In the living room, Jerry is carefully putting the old brush into a plastic bag,|
being very careful not to touch it with his bare skin. He then seals the bag.
the Plax too.
Jenna takes a sip from a glass as if to gargle.
|Just before Jenna emerges from the bathroom, Jerry throws the bag with the brush|
out of the window.
|Jenna approaches Jerry, clearly intending to kiss him. As Jenna leans toward|
|him, Jerry gets a flashback of the toothbrush plunging into the toilet bowl, in|
|black and white, with portentous music. From his viewpoint, we see Jenna's lips|
|looming toward him. He looks nauseated by the prospect of the kiss, and pulls|
away.

disorder.
it is.
We see Jerry and Elaine's view of the road signs. 'Mile 114' 'Adopt-a-Highway'
and 'Litter removal next 1 Mile KRAMER'.
Kramer is standing on the verge beside a large pile of plastic bags full of
|trash, a couple of brooms lean against the crash barrier. He has an armful of|
|assorted garbage. Jerry's car passes in the traffic, and a brief beep of the|
horn is heard.
|He claps his hands in satisfaction, and looks out at 'his' road. He notices|
|something. In the middle of the road is a Coke can, crushed by traffic.|
|Kramer makes a decision, and dashes out into the traffic to retrieve the can.|
His progress to the can is accompanied by the squeal of brakes and the blare of
|horns as the traffic passes him. As he reaches the can, one car has to come to a|
|complete stop. Kramer grabs the can and hurries back to the side of the road,|
where he leans on the barrier.
|Elaine is in the hallway of a building, outside Apartment 1A. She knocks at the|
door and a guy opens it.
|(coughs nervously) I was wondering, if it wouldn't be too much trouble, if I|
could use your apartment to order some food?
just need like a half an hour to an hour.
The man shuts the door in her face.
|Elaine turns to leave, and as she does she sees an unmarked door opposite which|
stands open. She crosses over for a closer look. It's clearly a janitor's
|closet, with the usual fixings. A thought occurs to Elaine, and a smile comes to|
her face.
Jerry has just entered and is removing his coat. Kramer is in the kitchen
cleaning highway signs in the sink.
|the big stuff was easy. Cinderblocks, air-conditioners, shopping carts (makes|
|sound - fzup!), I just rolled 'em into the woods.|

car-pool lane.
The buzzer buzzes.
|Jerry buzzes Jenna in, opens the door and indicates to George and Kramer that|
their presence is no longer required.
|which I'm ready to do now, if you are ready.|
|Jenna moves in for the kiss. As she leans towards Jerry, he gets that revolted|
look on his again and turns his face away.
|brought it up too fast and I banged it into my lip, (lower voice and hurriedly)|
and then I knocked your toothbrush into the toilet and I wasn't able to tell you
before you could use it.
|out of here, please?|
Kramer brings his signs from the kitchen and Jerry picks up those which were on
his table. Together they carry them across the hall to Kramer's apartment.
|As Jerry is about to return to his apartment, the door is slammed shut. He tries|
|to open it, but it has been locked.|
|Jenna departs, leaving Jerry looking around him. He's wide-eyed, looking panicky|
and disgusted.
|Jerry is on the phone. His table is covered with bottles of cleaning fluids,|
|disinfectants, etc.. He is wearing a rubber glove to hold a spatula. Elaine is|
eating an apple and watching him.
Hello? Dammit!
|Frustrated, he throws the spatula into the waste bin.|
|Jerry picks up the walkman and begins to deposit it in the trash, then a thought|
occurs to him. Elaine sits on the couch and picks up the phone.
|Jerry thinks for a second, then he throws the walkman in the garbage anyway.|
Kramer enters carrying a box.
|quick, but they're there.|
|From the box, Kramer picks up square orange reflective objects.|
|ride? Well, I'm bringing that concept to mile one-fourteen.|
Elaine has the receiver from the phone held to her ear.
|Kramer is applying something from Jerry's table of cleaning fluids, etc, to his|
|neck, like a cologne.|
The delivery boy from China Panda in the hallway. He knocks at the door to the
|janitor's closet. He looks at the label on the door, which is a piece of tape|
with '1Q' crudely written in magic marker. He waits for a couple of seconds then
|knocks again. Elaine opens the door, with a towel wrapped around her head, as if|
her hair is wet.
She takes the bag with her order and hands over some money. The delivery boy is
trying to see past her into the 'apartment'.
|She shuts the door, leaving the delivery boy looking a tad bemused.|
George stands by the filled pothole. A highway maintenance truck is parked next
|to it. A trio of workers approach George, and the senior man speaks.|
Kramer is driving his car slowly along the Expressway. On either side of his
|boot is balanced an orange road cone. The traffic is passing him, and the blare|
of horns is regularly heard.
|Kramer opens the driver side door. He picks up a paint roller, and loads it with|
black paint from a tray on the passenger seat. Then he leans out of the door and
|rolls the paint over the lane markers, still steering the car with his other|
hand.
|Elaine emerges from the janitor's closet. She's wiping her lips, following the|
|flounder repast. As she does so, a woman walking along the hall notices her.|
|shoulda been downstairs in the basement, cleaning out those old carpets and|
scrap wood.
|Kramer is in bed. His alarm goes off, and the radio comes on in the middle of|
the traffic report. Kramer wakes up and listens.
|for some reason four lanes are converging into two, instantaneously right at|
|mile-marker one-fourteen. I don't know what that is, but the A-B's a parking lot|
out there. Somebody screwed up on that one.
|By the end of the report, Kramer looks slightly worried.|
|Elaine stands waiting in the closet. There's the usual paraphernalia - buckets,|
|brooms, cleaning materials, stepladder, boxes, etc.. There's a knock at the|
door. Elaine opens it to find Jerry.
slop-bucket.
There's another knock at the door.
The door is pushed open from the outside. It thumps into George who is pushed
|into Elaine, who stumbles into Jerry.|
don't wanna lose my baby!
There's yet another knock at the door. More strident.
|Allister. (to guys) Okay, I've gotta get out.|
|Elaine struggle to squeeze past George, and then Kramer to reach the door. The|
she has to make room to swing the door inwards.
|She succeeds in squeezing out, and stumbles into the hallway. The crush behind|
her slams the door shut.
|In the closet, the guys are struggling together with equipment and supplies in|
the cramped space. The thumps of their movements can be heard in the hallway.
|Jenna enters and sits, Jerry closes the door behind her. It is clear that Jerry|
has gone overboard in his efforts to dispose of whatever was contaminated - his
|kitchen shelves are bare, and most other surfaces are free of the usual|
knick-knacks.

He hands the keys to Elaine.
sorts of... (he cracks) Alright! You win! That car was my last germ-free
|sanctuary. I slept there last night! Now, for the love of God, please, what is|
it? What is it?!
|Elaine strides along the sidewalk looking very blue-collar in overalls and cap,|
|grimy face, etc. She has some old carpet slung over one shoulder and some paint|
|cans in her hand. A jackhammer can be heard. As she walks along, she passes|
George who is holding the jackhammer. She nods acknowledgment and he touches the
peak of his hardhat. George gives the pothole a burst from the jackhammer.
Kramer struggles to lift a forty-gallon drum into the boot of his car. He
eventually heaves it in.
|Jerry and Jenna, sitting on the couch, eating and conversing (looks like Chinese|
food).
|mishap get in the way of, what could be, a meaningful, long-lasting|
relationship.
|George is giving the street a long burst from the jackhammer. Suddenly, there is|
|a clang. George stops hammering, and listens. There is a deep rumbling sound,|
|from beneath his feet, which seems to be getting louder. He looks around for the|
source of the noise.
|Jenna and Jerry are still eating on the couch. The rumbling noise can be heard,|
|though not so loud as outside. Then, in the bathroom, the toilet starts to|
rattle.
|They both listen intently. The rumble continues and, in the bathroom, the toilet|
|rattles again, the cistern shaking.|
Jenna gets up and goes to the bathroom door.
|There is a rending sound, and a huge jet of water erupts from the ground right|
|in front of George, where he was hammering. There is a shot from above the|
rising column of water. On the top rises George's keyring.
|The plume of water rises high above George, who can be seen looking up at the|
height of it.
|In the bathroom, Jenna is peering curiously at her rattling toilet, wondering|
|what's wrong. She leans toward the bowl. Jerry is in the living room, still|
talking to her.
whatever.
|There is the sound of a wet explosion and splashing water, followed by Jenna|
screaming in the bathroom. Jerry leaps to his feet and rushes to see what has
happened.
|Jerry enters the bathroom and sees Jenna. Only her forearm is visible to us, but|
it's enough for us to know that she is wringing wet as the result of a violent
eruption from the toilet bowl.
|Jerry's face registers his obvious distaste. He shrugs, sorry.|
He closes the bathroom door as he leaves.
Elaine driving. The passenger seats are piled with the garbage from the basement
|- old carpets, bits of timber, boxes, etc. An external shot of the car reveals|
|she is driving on Kramer's section of road, as the black-painted lane markers|
can be seen.
We see the Saab weave across the extra wide lanes. From the boot falls a
battered sewing machine. It sits in the middle of the carriageway.
Kramer is manhandling the forty gallon drum out of his boot. He struggles to
|heave it clear, and then he drops it. The drum falls onto its side, and the lid|
|comes off, spilling the contents across the road.|
|Newman is singing as he drives. Beside him are a stack of boxes, marked 'Fresh|
Fish'.
There's a loud crash as the truck runs over the sewing machine. Tyres squeal as
Newman regains control.
The truck is travelling along with the sewing machine caught on the front axle.
|As it scrapes along the road, it leaves a huge trail of sparks behind.|
Kramer rights the empty drum and does a double-take as he notices the warning
labels on the side - 'Paint Thinner' 'Highly Flammable'.
|Newman still singing, although the grinding sound of the sewing machine is|
almost drowning out his voice. The sewing machine is still producing a shower of
sparks under the truck.
|Suddenly, the truck clearly reaches the pool of thinner and the sparks ignite|
|it. Flames shoot up around the truck, and are reflected in the windows. Newman|
begins screaming and yelling in the midst of the inferno.
Kramer finally manages to get the drum back into his boot and slams the lid
|down. Then he sees Newman staggering along the road. Newman is walking stiffly,|
|and is singed all over, with blackened patches on his hair and clothing. He's|
|staring ahead, clearly in such a state of shock that he's uncomprehending of his|
surroundings.
Newman still doesn't respond. In the distance the sound of sirens can be heard.
|Kramer hears them, looks worried, and moves toward the car.|
Kramer has the driver's door open and is impatient to be off. The sirens
continue.
|He starts the car, and leaves with a squeal of protesting tyres. Newman|
continues his walk.
|As the Castle Rock logo comes up, Newman can be heard screaming 'Aargh!'.|
We're never getting home.
Kramer stands up on the back seat.
Kramer and Jerry sit listening to the radio.
RADIO What a comeback for the New York Mets-- 6 runs in the bottom of the ninth.

other people queuing behind her.

Jerry can be seen struggling against his instincts. He hears George's words from
earlier.

|Kramer goes to shake Gary by the hand, but due to his impaired vision, he misses|
by several inches at the first attempt. He lifts the patch up to restore his

The eye patch-wearing cop spots a familiar Dodge.
He moves in for the kill.
The guy Elaine bought the glasses from is peering blurrily about. It's clear he
can barely see anything. He steps between cars and out into the road.
|The sound of tires squealing is heard from outside, followed immediately by the|
crash of cars colliding. Kramer leaps to his feet and heads out to investigate.

walking towards the exit of the clothing dept.)
(Jerry makes a smudged up face -- he knows he cannot get out of the
deal. Bania turns and walks quickly out of the clothing department.
Jerry sees a woman from the back walking into the dressing room area.
She has a fur coat on and is carrying a few items over her arm to try
on)
|(Elaine stands at the register counter, now she wears her own clothes.|
The Calvin Klein dress rests across the counter -- she watches as Jerry
follows the woman into the dressing room area. Jerry stands in front of
|the door where she went into, listens for a half second and then pushes|
|the door open, as she has not had an opportunity to latch it yet -- It|
|is Donna, the dry-cleaners wife -- she is stunned, startled and taken|
aback ...)
|(The camera pans down to the bottom of the dressing room door, so all|
|you see is Jerry and Donna's scuffling feet and lower legs, as Jerry|
takes the coat from her.)

The camera fades from the previous scene to the winter sidewalk outside.
|L-R Kramer, Elaine and Jerry walk silently in the cold. Above their|
heads in the background is a sign that reads “KalSigns” -- I believe
this is an homage to Jerry's (real life) father that owned a sign
company.
Kramer is wearing Jerry's mother's fur coat. It is obviously too small
for his large frame -- the arms are way too short. The coat comes down
to his mid thigh. He has no pants on. He wears shoes and white socks.
|He looks ridiculous, uncomfortable and cold.|
|Elaine is wearing a long winter overcoat, carrying her Calvin Klein|
dress in a garment bag over her left arm. Jerry has both hands in the
pockets of his winter jacket he is wearing a scarf that he had on
earlier in the store.
Kramer looks around as he walks along. He tries to button or close up
|the coat to the best of his ability, but nothing changes. As the scene|
|ends, the fur coat opens slightly at the bottom and you can see his|
|white boxer shorts (actually they look like jockey shorts, but earlier|

Jerry's standup piece.
Elaine and Jerry enter a store stocked with the toys of yesteryear.
|They look around at the array of classic teddy bears, toy boats, puppets, etc.|
|Jerry looks over, but his eye is drawn more towards an attractive|
|woman, Christie, who stands looking at the toys. She's wearing a dress of|
|mid-thigh length, black from the bottom of the ribs down, and white on the chest|
and arms.
|Christie leaves her examination of the toys on that side of the store,|
|and walks over to some other items. Jerry watches her as she goes, she notices|
and smiles and flirtatious looks are exchanged. Jerry is oblivious to Elaine's
voice.
Elaine gives up on Jerry assisting her and tries to lift the bike off
|the wall on her own. But as she raises it, the weight proves too much and she|
|falls backwards, ending up on her back on the floor with the bike pinning her|
|down. She struggles to lift it, but can't make much impression, so she rings|
the bell on the bike. Jerry finally has his attention drawn away from Christie.
|Elaine makes 'So, are you gonna help me?' gestures.|
George and Susan are having dinner with Ken and Carrie. Carrie is
Heavily pregnant. George is eating spaghetti with his usual decorum.
|cousins. So your baby daughter is gonna be Susan's second cousin, right? So what|
does that make me?
George laughs and shovels another load of pasta into his mouth. Ken and
Carrie look perturbed.
|Jerry sits in front of the TV, while in the kitchen Kramer is building|
A sandwich of epic proportions. He hums to himself as he piles sliced
|meat onto bread. Jerry looks over at him, looking somewhat irritated by the way|
Kramer's demolishing his food stocks.
|No, I said mustard, Jerry. Dijon.|
Kramer waves away the squeezy option and shuts the fridge.
|Kramer goes back to his sandwich, puts the second slice of bread on,|
and takes a bite. It doesn't meet with his approval. He spits out the mouthful he's
|taken onto the plate, and dumps the rest of the sandwich next to it.|

|Elaine enters. She has her head leaning over to the left, and she's|
|Moving carefully, like it's giving her pain.|
Kramer takes a firm grip of each side of Elaine's head. Elaine looks
Really worried now. She grabs a hold of Jerry's shirt and the arm of the
|couch, and her feet stamp on the floor.|
Kramer violently twists Elaine's head to the left. There's a loud

Of reliability? Hmm? Huh? Ahh. These were not easy questions to answer.

Christie leads Jerry into her home.
Christie walks away down a hallway. Jerry removes his coat and sits
down. He looks around himself. On the coffee table he notices a small framed

written on the photo.
She never

Elaine and Jerry enter a store stocked with the toys of yesteryear.
|They look around at the array of classic teddy bears, toy boats, puppets, etc.|
Something on the wall catches Elaine's eye. It's an old-fashioned
|girl's bicycle, with high handlebars, a pink frame and a basket on the front.|
|Jerry looks over, but his eye is drawn more towards an attractive|
|woman, Christie, who stands looking at the toys. She's wearing a dress of|
|mid-thigh length, black from the bottom of the ribs down, and white on the chest|
and arms.
|model! Oh, I always wanted one of these when I was little.|
|Christie leaves her examination of the toys on that side of the store,|
|and walks over to some other items. Jerry watches her as she goes, she notices|
and smiles and flirtatious looks are exchanged. Jerry is oblivious to Elaine's
voice.
Elaine gives up on Jerry assisting her and tries to lift the bike off
|the wall on her own. But as she raises it, the weight proves too much and she|
|falls backwards, ending up on her back on the floor with the bike pinning her|
|down. She struggles to lift it, but can't make much impression, so she rings|
the bell on the bike. Jerry finally has his attention drawn away from Christie.
|Elaine makes 'So, are you gonna help me?' gestures.|
George and Susan are having dinner with Ken and Carrie. Carrie is
Heavily pregnant. George is eating spaghetti with his usual decorum.
|cousins. So your baby daughter is gonna be Susan's second cousin, right? So what|
does that make me?
George laughs and shovels another load of pasta into his mouth. Ken and
Carrie look perturbed.
|Jerry sits in front of the TV, while in the kitchen Kramer is building|
A sandwich of epic proportions. He hums to himself as he piles sliced
|meat onto bread. Jerry looks over at him, looking somewhat irritated by the way|
Kramer's demolishing his food stocks.
|No, I said mustard, Jerry. Dijon.|
Kramer waves away the squeezy option and shuts the fridge.
|Kramer goes back to his sandwich, puts the second slice of bread on,|
and takes a bite. It doesn't meet with his approval. He spits out the mouthful he's

|C'mon, you gotta do this in person. It doesn't even have to be one on one, you can|

|money's a very different thing before and after you eat. Before you eat money has no value. And you don't care about money when you're hungry, you sit down at a|
|restaurant. You're like the ruler of an empire. "More drinks, appetizers, quickly, quickly! It will be the greatest meal of our lives." Then after the meal, you know,|
|you've got the pants open, you've got the napkins destroyed, cigarette butt in the mashed potatoes - then the check comes at that moment. People are always upset,|
|you know. They're mystified by the check. "What is this? How could this be?" They start passing it around the table, "Does this look right to you? We're not hungry|
now. Why are we buying all this food?!"
I think Superman probably has a very good sense of humor.

|our fault. We're not responsible. We just ruin the clothes. That ends our legal obligation." You see, the whole problem with dry cleaning is that we all believe that this|
|is actually possible. Right? They're cleaning our clothes - but they're not getting anything wet. It's all dry. I know there's gotta be some liquids back there, some fluids|
|that they're using. There's no such thing as dry cleaning. When you get something on your shirt, ever get something on your shirt and try to get it off like that (brushes|
|shirt) - that's dry cleaning. I don't think that's what they're doing back there. They don't have eighty guys going (with imaginary brush) "Come on, hurry up! There's a|
lot of shirts today."
|what he's got. But for a sick guy, he's very strong.|
|ought to coever it. (He hands her some money, she turns to leave, George stops her) Just a second.. Just a.. let me.. (looks at the check, then take some money out|
|of her hand.) (Urging Jerry and Elaine to eat) Come on, come on, come on..|
|know what I mean? 'Cause you send your money out there - working for you - a lot of times, it gets fired. You go back there, "What happened? I had my money. It|
|was here, it was working for me." "Yeah, I remember your money. Showing up late. Taking time off. We had to let him go."|
|So I was in the drug store the other day, trying to get a cold medication. You|
ever try and pick one of these out? It's not easy. It's a wall. It's an
|entire wall of cold medication, you stand there, you're going, "Alright,|
|alright, alright, okay, what the hell-- This is quick acting, but this is long|
|lasting. When do I need to feel good, now or later?" It's a tough question.|
And they always show you the commercials on TV where they show you what's wrong
|with the guy, you know? They always show you, like, all the problems that he's|
|having. First of all, the always show you the human body, which is usually this|
|guy. No face, mouth open, this is how drug companies see the public. And he's|
|always in, like, a certain pain, it's like red wavy lines are going through him|
|or he's glowing, parts of him are on fire sometimes, lightning is attacking him.|
|I never had a doctor say to me, "Are you having any pain?" "Yes I am." "Are|

Mid-episode monologue
All plans between men are tentative. If one man should suddenly have an
|opportunity to pursue a woman, it's like these two guys never met each other|
ever in life. This is the male code. And it doesn't matter how important the
|arrangements are, I mean, most of the time when they scrub a space shuttle|

|"So listen, when I get back what do you say we get together for some Tang?"|
|Island. What are your thoughts about taking a ride? You sure? Okay, but don't|
|leave me hanging here. Okay, great. Let me give you directions.|
|Cut to several hours later. The party has ended. The hosts, Steve and Jenny,|
|are cleaning up, Elaine and Jerry are still there.|
(To Jerry) The wife keeps giving us dirty looks. Are you sure you gave him the
right directions?
|the address was 8713 Riviera Drive. Uh uh, so I drove around knocking on|
|everybody's doors that had those numbers; 8317, 7813, 3718, 1837, whoo.|
|Finally, I hit it. 8173.|
|forty degree temperature for fifty minutes. Do the math. Yeah, maybe I will|

to hang out with someone in show business.

Every time I go to the bathroom I pass her desk. I have to plan little patter.

|how it went. If it was a good conversation, I don't go to the bathroom for the|
|rest of the day. I see her laughing and talking with other people, they're all|
|so loose and relaxed, I think, 'that used to be me. I want to go back there|
again.'

Cut back to Jerry and George at the drugstore. Jerry is selecting medication.

|Steve walks out, leaving the front door open.|
|There's two types of favors, the big favor and the small favor. You can measure|
the size of the favor by the pause that a person takes after they ask you to 'do

George gets on another subway. Sits next to a beautiful woman. They smile to
another.
Kramer rushes to yet another subway and tries to find a seat. Stumbles
around as all seats get filled right before him.
He squeezes himself to same seat with obese young man.
Jerry is falling asleep and leans towards the next guy who leaves and Jerry

Train horn blows and George looks back
Elaine's train. She's carrying a wedding present. A older woman approaches
her

Kramer's train. A man leaves and lefts a newspaper to his seat.
Kramer and another guy glance each other and rush to get the paper. The
other man gets to it first and Kramer gets only little piece of one page.
Jerry's train. He is still sleeping and trying not to fall to the floor.
Man across gives him a look.
Elaine's train. Train is full packed.
|I'll meet somebody, umm maybe not.|
Train suddenly stops
I wanna get off.
He gets stuck between closing doors.
Don't start the train!!
Kramer is reading a newspaper. Couple of men behind him are talking.
Every horse he has ever given me has won.
|See, they've been sandbagging and looking for a good spot. He's been|

Elaine is still trapped in a stopped train.

Kramer is in the "Off-track betting" office. The race is on and Pappanick
is slowly making ground
yes...
The winner is Pappanick
Kramer collects the winnings. A big pile of cash. Shows the money around.
There is a big thug looking at the money.
Kramer goes into the subway and sees that the thug followed him. He makes
a run for it. Thug follows. Kramer steps out of the train and so does the
|thug. Kramer tries to jump back on the train, but door closes.|
The naked man has put his clothes back on and he and Jerry are getting of
the train.
I haven't had a hotdog at Nathan's for 20 years.
Chilly out.
Jerry takes a deep breath
Kramer is running away from the thug and enters the train where the blind
violinist is playing. Kramer knocks down the violin player and the thug
picks Kramer up and looks for the money.

|The thing I don't understand about the suicide person is the people who try and commit suicide for some reason they don't die and that's it. They stop trying. Why? Why don't they just keep trying? What has changed? Is their life any better now? No. In fact it's worse because now they've found out one more thing you stink at. Okay, that's why these people don't succeed in life to begin with. Because they give up too easy. I say, pills don't work, try a rope. Car won't start in the garage, get a tune up. You know what I mean?

|But with a lot of hard work and a little bit of luck, I think there's a good chance you may, one day, walk again.|
[JERRY and KRAMER are walking down the street at dusk.]

I am springin' ahead riiight now.

[JERRY sees MIKE down the sidewalk. MIKE's peering into a shop window.]

|[ELAINE's at work, with PEGGY at Peggy's drafting table, looking at Peggy's designs. (PEGGY is an older, thin woman.)]|

|[At the door, ELAINE turns around, wondering if she heard right, and should she say anything. PEGGY looks up, pleasantly|
|nods at her, and returns to her work. ELAINE wavers and decides to let it drop, and leaves.]|
|[That night at Monk's, JERRY and ELAINE are sitting in a booth.]|

[GEORGE has just come in and grabs a chair to put a garment bag on.]

What's in the bag?

[GEORGE and ALLISON are coming into George's "house."]

[mock-snide] Is that the best you could do? Ha ha!

[Jerry's "house." JERRY and GEORGE are just coming in.]

|She tried to end it with me, Jerry.|

|[determined] If she can't find me, she can't break up with me. And, if we're still goin' out, she has to gooo to the ballll.|

Oo-oo! That's some sweet action!

|[ELAINE's at the office, walking past PEGGY's office. PEGGY's reading a memo and notices her.]|

Susie!

She practically ran the company into the gro-ound.

[PEGGY feels quite threatened..]
|[GEORGE is in his living room, watching TV, eating popcorn. The phone rings and he lets the machine pick it up as he munches|

[muttering] I hate that stupid message.
|[terse] I know you're avoiding me, I'm at the office, please call me, I've gotta talk to you. [hangs up]|
[GEORGE dials a number.]

|from ya, really looking forward to the ball.. [hangs up and happily chuckles] Ha ha!|
|[At JERRY's apartment, ELAINE's just arrived.]|

[PETERMAN's office. ELAINE comes to the door.]

Peggy says this "Suze" isn't much of a Worker.

|right here, in my office.|

[ALLISON's apartment. Someone's knocking on the door and she gets it. It's KRAMER.]

|the Rockets are in town an' that, Hakeem Olajuwon? Ohhh--he's got a real attitude.|

|[On the street, JERRY is leisurely unloading his groceries from the back of his car.]|

[MIKE gets some groceries out.]

|[As MIKE puts his hands there, JERRY, unaware, shuts the trunk again! It happens very fast--MIKE's hands are slammed and he screams out in pain!]|
|[The Pomodoro Restaurant is a dark romantic place, roses at the tables. GEORGE is sitting at a table with|
[amused] An' why Pomodoro?
|[Just now, at one table in the background, a WOMAN is sad and dismayed, says, "How could you say that to me?" She|
cries..]

|You know, I'm getting to a point in my life where I need something more than just.. a good time. [is tearing up]|

|[breathes in, pause] We're through..|

[PETERMAN and PEGGY are sitting in his office. There are two empy chairs. The window overlooks central park.]

|No, we're not--|

[breathes in] name names!

|requires, a Susie-and-Elaine solution! And, who better to do that than.. Elaine and Susie! Susie and Elaine!|

What was your name again.
[Jerry's. KRAMER and JERRY are talking. JERRY's eating lunch at his table.]

Did you do this? [MIKE has two hand casts on]

|[MIKE's very grateful, and leaves with a two thumbs-up gesture. But he also can't help giving a thumbs-up--that's the position the casts hold his thumbs in. It's odd!]|

|[GEORGE comes up (the door's still open) and when he and KRAMER see each other, there's an awkward, long pause. During the following, JERRY sits at the table silently watching, intrigued.]|

|[Another pause. It's like they broke up--well they did, but they didn't.]|

It's funny.
You look good..

|You know, it's gettin' kind of late, I, I really have to be going, so, uh, it's nice seeing you again, all right--|

|[Outside it's raining. MIKE is working on Jerry's trunk, trying to get at the locking mechanism but it's hard with those casts on.]|

|[He gets into the trunk for better access. But it turns out KRAMER is getting into his car, parked just ahead of Jerry's, and he bumps Jerry's car while backing up and the trunk slams shut. It locked this time!]|

Help!
|Somebody, help! Help!|
|[That night, ELAINE and JERRY are in the car, talking. He's driving.]|



[briefly stops to point and explain] That bumper sticker.
|[They BOTH scream, laughing! In the trunk, MIKE has heard most of the conversation! The laughing continues!]|

|[At night, GEORGE is upset and knocking on Kramer's door.]|

[sigh] All right.

I'm gonna make you both so happy!

|[The next day, ELAINE's passing by the door of PETERMAN's office.]|

|[difficult subject, quiet] she took her own Life..|
|[PETERMAN grasps this, weepy in disappointment, "Oh!". ELAINE comforts him.]|
[Allison's apartment. KRAMER knocks and ALLISON gets it.]

[ALLISON looks doubtful/disappointed.]
|[Inside, there are chairs lined up in rows, most are filled. There's a podium on a riser, flowers everywhere.]|

|[They've found seats together in the row in front of PEGGY, who looks like she's seeing a ghost!]|

[quiet] Susie?

Excuse me. [she's going to the podium]

[indicating ELAINE] Her too.
[ELAINE's now at the podium.]

|[Meanwhile, out in the parking lot, PETERMAN arrives in his little red convertible (top down), distracted with|
disappointment/sadness. He parks behind Jerry's car and bumps it. Jerry's trunk has unlatched but not popped open big.
|PETERMAN doesn't notice anything and goes in. Shortly after he passes, MIKE comes out of the trunk, squinting in the|
|daylight, his body is sore, he shuts the trunk.|
|Nearby, there's a small announcement sign (with stick-in white letters):|

MIKE sees it and is alarmed! He's still disoriented but hobbles away with determination!]
|[Tavern on the Green, at dusk. The Pinstripe Ball is starting. The walls there are mahogany, and there are short, decorative|
|columns with flowers on top of them. Everyone is in tuxedos and gowns, and the music is mellow and quiet. GEORGE is|
|waiting in a tux for Allison, but KRAMER arrives in his rather tight tux. They talk quietly.]|

How d'ya like the tuxedo. It's a rental but I've had it for fifteen years.
|All right, eh. [heading in]|

|[They start struggling quietly, KRAMER's trying to just walk by, and GEORGE is trying to restrain him without attracting too|
much attention.]

|[GEORGE had KRAMER in a slightly spinning hold--by holding the back of KRAMER's tux--but the material tore away, and|
|this sent KRAMER spinning into the room with the back torn off his tux! Strangely, this is well-received by WILHELM!]|

|[friendly, to GEORGE] And eh, who might this be?|

|[Meanwhile at the Memorial, ELAINE is still at the podium. She has her chin in her hand while talking, weary of making up|
things and of acting mournful.]

|I don't think I'll ever be able to forget Susie--ahhh. And most of all, I will never, forget that one night. Working late on the|
catalogue. Juuust the two of us. And we surrendered to temptation.
And it was Pretty Good.

|[ELAINE (who has returned to her seat) catches JERRY's eye. Though we don't see her face, his drops and he sobers it up.]|

An' nowww.. Susie is gone.

Susie didn't commit suicide!
|[rushes up to podium!] She was Murdered, by Jerry, Sein-feld!|
|[While MIKE's pointing at JERRY and everyone's looking, JERRY looks back at PEGGY again.]|

|[(During her screaming up to the air, the camera was over her, looking down, and turning around and around, just like it had|
when GEORGE found out that he was going to be running a foundation in honor of Susan!)]

E What could I do? She said there might be something for me at Doubleday.
Oh wouldn't that be great I wouldn't have to work for Mr. Pitt anymore.

|way he left, you know? That was a mess. I never should have taken back those|
keys.
the Kosher meal? I hear the Kosher meal is good. And I need clothes. Gotta
|get a haircut. Gonna have to, I have to refill my allergy medication. Oh, do I|
|need a hat? I need a hat, don't I? Could we do the Universal tour? They have|
|that Backdraft exhibit now, that looks very cool to me...|
|Kramer, backstage, talking to some aspiring young actors.|
|color, imagining color, then finding the emotional vibrational mood connected to|
|the color. See, if you look through my scripts, you'll see that all my lines|
|have a special color, so I don't memorize language, I memorize color. This way|
|I can go through red, yellow, green, blue. And I have a full palette of|
emotions.
Kramer's apartment building in LA. Singers and actors are heard practicing in
the background. Kramer leaves his apartment and makes a call on the pay phone
in the hall.
|Go ahead, it's all yours.|
|Helena, a neighbor, steps into the hallway.|
|big meeting, I got these people interested in my movie treatment. So, uh, I|
|guess we'll have to make it another time, alright?|
Kramer!
Jerry's apartment. George walks in with several stuffed suitcases and
backpacks.
|subtle variations, only discernable to an acute observer, that reflect the many|
|moods, the many shades, the many sides of George Costanza.|
The security guard begins waving a small beeping detector up and down Jerry's
body.
|Monologue, Jerry on stage.|
Seems to me that the closest thing we have to Royalty in America are the people
that get to ride in those little carts through the airport. Don't you hate
|these things? They come out of nowhere; Beep Beep, cart people, look out, cart|
people! Look out! We all scurry out of the way like worthless peasants. Oooh!
|It's cart people! I hope we didn't slow you down. Wave to the cart people,|
|Timmy, they're the best people in the world. Ya know, if you're too fat, slow|
|and disoriented to get to your gate on time, you're not ready for air travel.|
The other people I hate are the people that get on to the moving walkway and
|then just stand there. Like it's a ride? Excuse me, there's no animated|
pirates or bears along the way here. Do your legs work at all?
Stock photo of the HOLLYWOOD sign. Cut to a casting office. Kramer enters.
Cut to a montage of Kramer in group auditions for the productions the
receptionist mentioned.
|Kramer and Chelsea, a woman he met in the horror movie audition, exit the|
casting office.
|I mean think about it, is that a great idea? We know nothing about Eva Braun,|
only that she was Hitler's girlfriend.
bunker? What did her parents think of Hitler as a potential son-in-law? I mean
it could just go on and on...
|opportunity. (takes a deep breath) I gotta go over there, I gotta give him a|
copy of my treatment.
|luck, huh?|
Kramer gets up and approaches Fred Savage who's sitting at a table nearby.
|weird, but I'm just like you, I'm just a regular guy just trying to make it in|
|this business. You know I really like your work, the, uh...|
|cool and charming, I don't mean to bother you or anything but I think it's fate|
that you happened to be here at the same time as me.
|Fred takes the treatment and bolts for the door. After he leaves, Kramer gives|
the rest of the patrons a thumbs-up.
George and Jerry are in their hotel room. Jerry's on the telephone.
|swirl them, you know what I mean? You know, I don't like being all tucked in.|
|I like to have a lot of room, you know I like to have my toes pointed up in the|
air. Just like to scrunch up the blankets.
|whole joke I was gonna do about the X-ray counter at the airport, I was gonna do|
|it on the Tonight Show, now I can't remember it.|
|As Jerry drives past, Kramer exits a printing shop, gets into his car and drives|
|off, spilling dozens of 8"x10" publicity photos. A police office notices this|
and picks up one of the photos.
|Another murder scene. A police officer pulls a blanket over the body's head,|
|but we catch a glimpse of the dead girl; it's Chelsea, Kramer's friend from the|
auditions. The same two Lieutenants as before are just arriving.
The Lt. examines the evidence. It's a title page that says "The Keys" A movie
treatment by Kramer. The paper is torn so that the space where Kramer's first
name was is missing.
Jerry leaves and Corbin Bernsen enters through a stage door. he stands near
|George, obviously waiting for someone.|
weeks. So she goes out of town and she asks me to feed her cat. So at this
|time, there's a lot of stuff going on in my life and, uh, it slips my mind for a|
|few days. Maybe a week. Not a week, five, six days.|
|natural causes. So get this, now she tells me that I gotta buy her a brand new|
|cat. I say listen, honey. First of all, it was a pretty old cat. I'm not|
|gonna buy you a brand new cat to replace an old dying cat. And second of all, I|
|go out to the garbage, I find you a new cat in fifteen seconds. I say, you show|
|me an autopsy report that says this cat died of starvation, I spring for a new|
|cat. So she says something to me, like, uh, I dunno, get the hell out of here,|
and she breaks up with me. Now don't you think that would be a great case on
L.A. Law?
Corbin Bernsen just stares at George.
|Flash forward, George is now talking with George Wendt in the same hallway.|
|George looks down, Jerry walks away.|
|The Tonight Show, George is in the audience applauding.|
|Bernsen, George Wendt and comedian Jerry Seinfeld.|
|Quick cut to Corbin Bernsen, mid-interview.|
|me a great case for L.A. Law, just a few seconds ago, right here, right outside|
|in the hallway this nut, some sick nut comes up to me and says he's supposed to|
watch this girl's cat while she's away out of town. Anyway he forgets to feed
|the cat, the cat dies, starves to death, he kills the cat, refuses to get her a|
|new one, won't give her any money, won't pay her, and he wants Arnie Becker to|
|represent him. Nice guy. Yeah, that'd make a *great* case for L.A. Law.|
Thanks a lot.
|Quick shot of the audience, everyone is laughing besides George.|
Cut to a police station. Helena is being questioned by Lt. Martel.
I think he may be in love with me. Of course there's nothing abnormal about
|that, I have many suitors.|
|Cut back to the Tonight Show, George Wendt, mid-interview.|
|people giving us advice, how to improve the show. Actually, a few moments ago I|
|ran into a nut back there, he said, you know, that maybe we should think about,|
|you know, not doing the show in a bar.|
|Another quick shot of the audience, again everyone is laughing besides George.|
Cut back to the police station. One of the kids from the van Kramer hitched a
ride to LA in (see "The Keys") known only as 'The Freak' is being questioned by
the Lt.
|before?" And he said, "What do you think, Junior? These hands have been|
soaking in Ivory liquid?
|Cut back to the Tonight Show, Corbin Bernsen and George Wendt are talking|
between takes.
|uh, uh, the uh, that uh, the conveyor belt.|
|Quick shot of the audience, nobody is laughing.|
Quick shot of an extremely uncomfortable Jerry.
Cut back to the police station. The Lt. is on the phone.
Kramer.
|George and Jerry are leaving the Tonight Show set,|
'Smog Stranglings'. Police have just released a photo of the suspect being
sought in connection with the slayings. He is known only as "Kramer".
George and Jerry stare at each other in disbelief.
Talk show hosts never seem to have any idea how much time is left in the show.
|You know, they're always looking off camera, "Do we have time? Are we out of|
time? How we doin' on time? Anybody know what the time is? What's the time?
|Check the time?" You never see Magnum P.I. go, "Should I strangle this guy or|
are we gonna take a break here? Can you stay for another beating? I'll tell
|you what, I'll bop him in the head, we'll do a commercial, we'll come back, I'll drive in the car real fast, stay with us."|
|There are many different job in the police. It seems to me, that the chalk outline guy is one of the better jobs that you can get. You know it's not dangerous, the criminals are long gone, that seems like a good one. I don't know who they are, I guess they're people who wanted to be a sketch artists, but they couldn't draw too well..."listen Johnson, forget the sketches. Do you think if we left a dead body right there on the sidewalk, you could manage to trace around it? Could you do that?". I don't even know how it helps to solve the crime? You know, they look at the thing on the ground..."aah his arm was like that when he hit the pavement. That means the killer must've been Jim."|
|The thing about L.A. to me, that kind of threw me, was when they have these smog alerts out there and they actually recommend that people stay indoors during the smog alert. Now, maybe I'm way off, but don't you think, wouldn't you assume, that the air in the house pretty much comes from the air in the city where the house is? I mean what do they think, that we live in a jar with couple of holes punched in the top? What the hell is going on out there? It's very strange, do you realize that it's now possible for parents to say to their children "All right kids, I want you in the house and get some fresh air! Summer vacation, everybody indoors."|
|Welcome everyone to the room...Ah, the extra button....yeah ... what kind of a sicko would save these ...have them in a huge file, drawers that wide (small fingers opening imaginary drawers) Where the hell is that ... I mean is it THAT hard to get round black buttons that they have to make it into such a great thing like this? ... is it such a great jacket ... the buttons are so unique, so one of a kind, you'll never find them - they save you the trouble of knocking your brain off - and we know they're going to fall off too, that's the other thing ...|

Jerry's Apartment
|home but as far as Mr. Johnson is concerned, that's another story.|
|Why is it so difficult, uncomfortable, to be naked. It's because when you have|
clothes on you can always kinda make those little adjustments that people like
|to do ... you feel like you're getting it together, yeah, yeah pretty good|
|(pulling at lapels, pockets etc.) feeling good looking good But when you're|
|naked it's like it's so final you're, Well that's it. (no movements) There's|
nothing else I can do. That's why I like to wear a belt when I'm naked. Cause I
|feel it gives me something, I know I'm naked, but you know, (tugging and|
|lifting belt) I like to get pockets to hang off of the belt that would be,|
wouldn't that be the ultimate? To be naked and still be able to do this (hand
in pocket) I think that would really help a lot.

Supposed to be good.
(Kramer enter - all bandaged up.
|I was audited last year. At first I thought well, IRS kinda sounds like Toys R Us maybe won't be so bad. Maybe they have a sense of fun about it, you know.|
|But it's it's bad. It's an ordeal. And they don't do anything to keep your spirits up through the ordeal. I think they should take all your receipts and put them in one of those big Lucite sweepstake and just kinda crank it around there. You know give me a feeling like you might win something. You know what I mean? Then they can pull them out one by one and go "Oh, I'm sorry that's another illegal deduction. But we do have some lovely parting gifts for you. Jail!"|

|What are lawyers, really? To me a lawyer is basically the person that knows the|
|rules of the country. We're all throwing the dice, playing the game, moving our|
|pieces around the board, but if there's a problem, the lawyer is the only person|
that has read the inside of the top of the box. I think one of the fun things
|for them is to say, "objection." "Objection! Objection, your Honor."|
|Objection, of course, is the adult version of, "Fraid not." To which the judge|
|can say two things, he can say, "overruled" which is the adult version of "Fraid|
|so," or he could say, "sustained," which is the adult version of "Duh."|
|First scene. George is at the counter at Monk's, he's talking with an Oriental woman.|
funny one. El Clowno.
Quick pan to the front door as Jerry and Elaine are entering.
there is no mail.
Cut back to George and Cheryl at the counter.
|incredible! Everything I said was funny! You know, she laughed at everything I|
|said, she thinks I'm hilarious. You know in a way, it was almost too good. I|
|started so good, I can't go any place but down now, ya know? I got no place to|
go.
never thank you enough for everything you do.
Cut back to George and Elaine.

with me to the auto show with me Saturday?
People should plunk down two-thousand dollars to live like him for a week. Do

They hear a noise from the hallway.
|and I was really throwing some smoke. And Joe Pepitone, he was up, and man that|

|trying to get Moose Skowron off of one of my teammates, you know, somebody pulls|
|me from behind, you know, and I turned around and I popped him. I looked down,|
|and woah man, it's Mickey. I punched his lights out.|
|everything was going so well for him. He had an apartment, he had a job. What|
a shame.

There's a knock on Kramer's door.

haunts me. He is a very bad man. He is a very very bad man.
I am for open immigration but that sign we have on the front of the Statue of
|Liberty, 'Give us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses...', can't we just|
|say, 'Hey, the door's open, we'll take whoever you got.'? Do we have to specify|
|the wretched refuse? I mean, why don't we just say, 'Give us the unhappy, the|
|sad, the slow, the ugly, people that can't drive, that they have trouble|

(Elaine throws down money on the table).
|sayin', Jerry, I'll go and I'll buy some jeans. (Jerry shrugs. Kramer raises his voice to a menacing tone) I swear to God I will! (Jerry's showing off a skeptical face.|
|Kramer points a finger at him) Don't think I won't, Jerry!|
|(Kramer enters wearing a new pair of jeans. They're obviously way too small. Unable to bend his knees, he walks awkwardly into the room. Elaine, Jerry, and|
|George are speechless - staring at him. Kramer walks past them, and attempts to pick a magazine off the table, but does so with great difficulty. Jerry starts to laugh|
as Kramer throws the magazine back down)

|Don't you hate "to be continued" on TV. It's horrible when you sense the "to be continued" coming. You know, you're watching the show. You're into the story. There's like five minutes left and suddenly you realize, "Hey, they can't make it." Timmy's still stuck in the cave. There's no way they wrap this up in five minutes. I mean the whole reason you watch a TV show is because it ends. If I want a long boring story with no point to it, I have my life. A comedian can't do that, see. I can't go, "A man walks into a bar with a pig under his arm - Can you come back next week?"|
|executive gifts, any stupid, goofy, brass, wood thing, they put a piece of green|
|felt on the bottom. "It's a golf, desk, tie and stress organiser, dad." But to|
|me, nothing compares with the paperweight as a bad gift. There's no better|
|way than a paperweight, to express to someone that, "I refuse to put any thought|
into this at all." Where are these people working that the papers are just
|blowing right off of their desks? What, are their desks screwed to the back of|
|a flat-bed truck going down the highway or something? What, are they|
typing up in the crow's nest of a clipper ship? What do you need a paperweight for?
|Jerry, Helen and Morty Seinfeld and uncle Leo are having dinner.|
|(indicates Jerry) He brings in a watch, it takes over a week to fix. He fixed|
yours in one day.
|mysteries, wrapped in a riddle.|
|Morty sits, brooding a little. A hostess, Naomi, passes the table.|
Helen watches her.
|week, and him a day. How could that be? Something's fishy about this.|
It wasn't my decision. It was Jerry! Jerry told me no. I'm the creative
guy. He handles the business end.
the whole deal like that? What kind of a maniac is this guy? I mean he
|just, he says no, and that's it?|
|George looks frustrated for a second, then notices Susan's purse on the|
|dash. He grabs it, Susan grabs it and a struggle ensues.|
Elaine and Kramer sit on the couch.
|of it. So you just tell him that you're my boyfriend and that we're in love,|
okay. Can you do that?
|You know, Gleason, he never rehearsed. (indicates phone) 'Kay, go 'head, do it.|
|Elaine picks up the phone, while Kramer prepares himself.|
|He waggles his eyebrows at Elaine, who gives a 'what the hell is he|
doing?' look.
we're much more than friends...
|Elaine signals her approval, indicating that Kramer should keep going.|
|point is, doctor uh, I'm very much in love with Elaine...|
Elaine smiles.
|would uh, appreciate it if you would cease and desist, and allow us to pursue|
our courtship unfettered.
|Elaine looks extremely pleased, she gives Kramer okay gestures.|
unpleasant for you and your staff. If you have one.
Elaine looks even happier. She slaps Kramer on the arm to indicate he's
doing so well.
|but I'd have to shift a few things around, uhm... Hold on for a second, will|
you? Uh...
|Kramer reaches down and picks up a writing pad, he puts it on his knee.|
|Elaine watches, looking increasingly confused and worried.|
|uh... Yeah, yeah, okay... I look forward to it too. (listens) Eh, hah, okay. So|
long.
Kramer hangs up the phone.
interesting.
|Elaine flops back into the couch, let down again by Kramer.|
|Naomi, the hostess, stands by the Seinfeld's table.|
Leo gets up and leaves. The busboy brings the check to the table. As he
|puts it down, Morty takes hold of it. Jerry grabs it too. A tug of war|
develops.
|know how you pick up a check with no money. 'Cause if this works, the whole|
|monetary system's obsolete, we're back to wampum. (standing) I'm going to the|
bathroom.
|Jerry walks away. Morty reads the check, with Helen leaning to read it|
too.
|Jerry enters, to find Leo washing his hands. Leo notices Jerry in the|
mirror.
|uh, rude to you that day I bumped into you on the street. Uh, I really did have|
to get to a meeting.
|Leo begins to head for the door. Jerry walks backwards, keeping pace|
with him.
proposition for you.
|A uniformed doorman is on the phone to a tenant, while a nervous George|
stands beside him.
|says, call him Monday.|
|A desperate George grabs the phone, and the doorman's hand, and pulls|
it down so's he can speak into it.
|minutes. Just five minutes of your time. (listens) Thank you! Thank you, Mister|
Dalrimple.
|George releases his grip on the phone, and indicates the doorman should|
|listen to it. Keeping a wary eye on George, he does.|
A happier George slaps the doorman on the shoulder and heads toward
Russell Dalrimple's apartment.
|Morty stands, explaining his predicament to the maitre d', who speaks|
with an approximate French accent.
|family, ah.|
Kramer and Elaine stroll to the entrance of Dr Reston's building.
|Kramer opens the door and begins to enter. Elaine waves him goodbye,|
then wonders why she's doing that and gives up.
Russell has opened the door to an anxious George. In the background is
|a set dinner table, at which sits Cynthia, Russell's beautiful date. She|
looks haughty and bored throughout the scene.
|Wow, this is some place. A duplex, huh? (indicating) Look at this, you got stairs in|
|an apartment. All my life, I dreamed about having steps in an apartment.|
|Even one step. Sunken living room. Although, one step is really not all that|
sunken. (tries hard to elicit a laugh)
|Jerry, yeah. (to Cynthia) Jerry's a friend of mine. (to Russell) He uh, he gave it|
to me. Unbelievable how many addresses of people this guy has.
Russell closes the door.
if I really wanted.
Cynthia rises and slinks past George toward the living room area.
|Cynthia sits on the couch, and puts her wine glass on the coffee table.|
|As George speaks, Russell crosses to the coffee table, picks up the glass|
|and puts down a coaster, before sitting the glass on it.|
|we got here, really? We really, really, just have a terrible misunderstanding.|
|You see, when I passed on the deal, I thought that's what Jerry wanted me to|
|say. Y'know, I, I misinterpreted.|
|huh? Businessmen. Colleagues, if I may. Let's not quibble. We'll do it for|
|the thirteen thousand. Thirteen thousand, and I never came up here, we|
|never talked, alright. You take good care. (moving past Russell toward the door) It|
|was nice seeing you again, and nice meeting you. (to Cynthia) Cynthia, right?|
George is opening the door.
|and now I'm going below what you wanted to pay. You have your dinner, have your|
|veal, or whatever it is. Enjoy...|
|George opens the door, and is halfway through.|
|Cynthia) Cynthia, again, nice meeting you. Have I commented on the shoes? I love|
|suede, it's so thick and rich. Did you ever, you ever rub it against the|
|grain? Alright, anyway...|
George is halfway through the door again.
George exits and Russell closes the door firmly. As Russell returns to
|Cynthia, there is a tentative tap at the door. Russell opens it, to reveal|
George.
Leo and Jerry are mid-negotiation over the watch.
|dollar watch, you paid forty to get it fixed. That's a hundred dollars. I'm|
offering you two hundred!
Jerry begins handing over a wad of bills to Leo. The door to the
bathroom opens and Morty enters.
|On the street outside, Elaine waits, while upstairs Kramer introduces|
himself to Dr Reston.
Dr Reston sits in one of a pair of leather armchairs which face each
|other, he crosses his legs.|
Kramer sits and the leather of the chair makes a series of embarrassing
|rumbles and squeaks, with more of the same as he emulates Dr Reston's crossed|
legs sitting position.
|He moves in his seat, resulting in another digestive tract rumble from|
the leather.
Elaine is waiting outside for Kramer. Along the street strolls Joe
|Davola, singing as he goes.|
|Davola stops and looks at Elaine. He looks like he likes what he sees,|
and Elaine seems interested too. They flirt.
They laugh and smile at each other.
Kramer and Dr Reston are also laughing.
are gonna make a wonderful couple.
Kramer strikes a match on the sole of his shoe.
|Kramer puts down the match, not noticing he's placed it on a box of|
tissues. He and Dr Reston puff contentedly at their cigars.
Kramer pulls the smouldering tissue from the box. He shakes it to put
|out the fire, but a piece falls to the floor. As he reaches for it, he keeps|
|the rest of the tissue in his hand, where it burns his fingers. He jumps, almost|
|dropping his cigar, and sucks at his burned digits.|
Elaine is using Davola's back as a rest as she jots her number on a
piece of paper.
Elaine hands the piece of paper and the pen back to Davola as they
laugh at the ludicrous possibility that he might be a nut.
Naomi is handing her card to Jerry.
|Naomi starts to laugh at his joke. It is, of course, the laugh later|
described as 'Elmer Fudd sitting on a juicer'. It's loud and persistent. Jerry
|leaves, but then leans back around the corner with a look of disbelief on his face.|
|A cheerful Joe Davola waits for the elevator to arrive, whistling 'Side|
By Side'. The elevator arrives with a ding of the bell. The door opens and
|Kramer steps out, shielded from Davola by other passengers. Kramer walks away,|
|relighting his cigar, as Davola enters the elevator, still whistling|
happily.
Elaine sits on the steps outside the building. The door opens and one
|of the other elevator passengers exits, he releases the door, which swings|
|shut, almost striking Kramer. Kramer walks toward Elaine.|
|Elaine and Kramer's voices fade out, and the voices inside the window|
fade up.
Jerry's standup piece.
|minutes? Wha, what do they do with that ten minutes that they have left? Do they just|
|sit there going, "Boy, that guy was crazy. I couldn't believe the things he|
|was saying. What a nut! Who's coming in next? Oh, no, another headcase!"|
Jerry brings his parents' cases from the bedroom. Helen is finishing
packing.
am.
The buzzer sounds.
wind up getting more money.
George enters.
are you?
He approaches Helen for a greeting.
There is an outpouring of jubilation and congratulations aimed at
George.
Jerry fetches a small package from the kitchen drawer and offers it to
Morty.
Uncle Leo has the trunk of his car open and looks impatient.
Jerry and George walk away to cross the street back to the apartment.
|They speak quietly, so's Helen and Morty don't overhear.|
Morty and Helen climb into Leo's car. Leo closes the trunk and walks
|toward the driver's door. He stops, as something catches his eye. Leo picks the|
|wallet out of the trash, looks around to see if anyone's watching, and tucks it|
into his pocket as he goes to get in the car.
Jerry's standup piece.
|wallet, is the photo section. True? Women carry with them a photograph of every|
|person they've ever met, every day in their whole lives, since the beginning|
|of time. And every picture is out of date. You know what I mean? It's, "Here's my|
|cousin, three years old. She's in the marines now." "This is my dog. He died|
|during the Johnson administration." You know. You get stopped by a cop, no|
|licence, no registration, (waves imaginary wallet) "Here's fifty-six people that|
|know me." Cop goes. "Alright, ma'am, just wanted to make sure you had some friends, move it along. Routine pal check."|
|Of all the places that you go all the time, the dry-cleaning relationship is one of the most bizarre. Because you keep giving each other the same thing, back and forth, over and over again. He gives it to you, you give it to him, he gives it back to you. It's like it's half his shirt, in a way. He has it as much as you do...you oughta go shopping with him. 'What do you think of this shirt?' 'That would look good with a light starch.' The only warning label people really respect is 'dry-clean only.' Y'know what I mean? Speed limits, lung cancer, cigarette warnings - your very life is at stake! People go, 'Ah, the hell with it!' But dry-clean only? 'Oh, don't put that in the wash! It's dry-clean only! Are you crazy?!'|

He stands to make a big commission too on that jacket with the crest that nobody seems
to like. You know what I'm gonna do.? I'm gonna take that jacket back.. I'm putting this guy

Jessie looks befuddled and leaves.
Back to Elaine's phone rings.
Elaine then looks at the sleeping Craig and thinks They make wigs out of human hair....And pay
plenty for them.
she then picks up a pair of scissors..
Scene cuts to a woman in a white coat and hat leaving a store. Her hat gets caught in a gust of wind.
and starts rolling down the street. Kramer picks up the hat with the walking stick and puts it on.
He struts down the street with the Dreamcoat/hat/stick looking very much like a stereotype pimp.
He goes to the Jiffy Park to pick up the Cadillac

George.

and smiles knowingly)
|else, you, uh, you really like 'em and that's why you, you do this.|

|being in the Hamptons, and move on)|
You're like the Grand Marshall of the Rose Bowl Parade. It's a Wizard
