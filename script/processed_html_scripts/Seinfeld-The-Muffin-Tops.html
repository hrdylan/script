Look at this." name="KRAMER" /><sd>Kramer walks off-screen and opens his shirt. On-screen, Jerry reels from the sight.</sd><char dialog="(high pitched voice) Look at it! Look at it! And it's all me.

LIPPMAN" /><char dialog="I know what you thought. They don't have homes, they don't have jobs, what do they need the top of a muffin for? They're lucky to get the stumps." name="REBECCA" /><char dialog="If the homeless don't like them the homeless don't have to eat them." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="The homeless don't like them." name="REBECCA" /><char dialog="Fine." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="We've never gotten so many complaints. Every two minutes, &quot;Where is the top of this muffin?
