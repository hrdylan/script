Lydia is laughing, Leo is not) I had lunch with him the other</sd><sd>day, he's one of these guys that anything goes wrong in life, he blames it on</sd><sd>anti-Semitism. You know what I mean, the spaghetti's not al dente? Cook's an</sd><sd>anti-Semite. Loses a bet on a horse. Secretariat? Anti-Semitic. Doesn't get</sd><sd>a good seat at the temple. Rabbi? Anti-Semite.</sd><sd>Jerry's apartment. Jerry is on the phone.</sd><char dialog="Hey, listen to this, Uncle Leo broke up with his girlfriend because of" name="JERRY" /><sd>the bit I did.
