This is Elaine." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Nice to meet you, Poppie." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Let me show you to your table. (Leads Jerry and Elaine to the table.) Your duck is cooking as we speak. It is so succulent...so succulent!" name="POPPIE" /><char dialog="Well, Kramer told us all about your business venture together." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Your friend and I are going to make a lot of money. Of course, I already have a lot of money.

You should never order pizza from Paccino's." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Why not?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Because, the owner contributes a lot of money to those fanatical, anti-abortion groups." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="So, you won't eat the pizza?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No way." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Really." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Well, what if Poppie felt the same way?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Well, I guess I wouldn't eat here, then." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Really!" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah. That's right." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Well, perhaps we should inquire. Poppie! Oh, Poppie. Could I have a word? (Poppie comes over.)" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yes, Jerry. I just checked your duck...it is more succulent than even I had hoped." name="POPPIE" /><char dialog="Poppie, I was just curious...where do you stand on the abortion issue?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="When my mother was abducted by the Communists, she was with child..." name="POPPIE" /><char dialog="Oh, boy." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="...but the Communists, they put an end to that! So, on this issue there is no debate! And no intelligent person can think differently." name="POPPIE" /><char dialog="Well...Poppie. I think differently." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="And what gives you the right to do that?" name="POPPIE" /><char dialog="The Supreme Court gives me the right to do that! Let's go Jerry, c'mon." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="I heard that. Let's go, Henry." name="WOMAN AT NEXT TABLE" /><char dialog="But we just got here..." name="HENRY" /><char dialog="And I am not coming back!" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="You're not welcome!" name="POPPIE" /><char dialog="Well, I'm certainly glad I brought it up.

I say, how's the book comin'?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Oh...pretty good." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="So, what's it about?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Well, it's about Holly Go-Lightly." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Holly Go-Lightly." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah, she's quite a character." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Yes, you haven't read a page, have you?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Big surprise." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I couldn't. You know, if it's not about sports, I find it very hard to concentrate." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="You're not very bright, are you?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No, I'm not. I would like to be, but I'm not. What am I gonna do? The book club meets in a few days." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Why don't you rent the movie?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="'Why don't I rent the movie.' See, this is when I like you. Alright, now I'm relieved.

(Elaine comes back from the bathroom.) Oh, Elaine! I was just asking how dinner went last night." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Oh...well..." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Alright, what did you do to Poppie?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Nothing." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Well, he's in the hospital. And the cook says you put him there." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="What's wrong with him?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="I don't know! I'm gonna go and visit him later. (angrily) It would be nice if you got him something.

You're right." name="ELAINE" /><sd>Elaine and Carl sitting in carl's moving van after a date.</sd><char dialog="Do you know that I have been using the same bottle of shampoo for a year? And I shampoo every day. (Carl smiles.) So, what do you think of my conversation?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Not much! (They both laugh.) I, uh, would have invited you up, but I don't have any furniture." name="CARL" /><char dialog="You don't have any furniture?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="No, I hate furniture. I can't look at it.

They're trying to kill Poppie?!" name="POPPIE" /><char dialog="Why, what...?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Don't they know I have a gastro-intestinal disorder? If I would have any of this, I would die. Then Poppie's no good to anyone! This is a sick, sick joke on Poppie. How could you be friends with those two?" name="POPPIE" /><char dialog="Well, we're not very close." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="They owe me for those ducks.

He's real, he's honest, he's unpretentious...oh, I'm really lucky!" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Did you tell him I was sorry I didn't offer him the drink?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No, I forgot. And, the best part is, he doesn't play games. You know? There are no games! (Sits down on the couch.)" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="No games? What is the point of dating without games? How do you know if you're winning or losing?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Well, all I know is, he doesn't like games and he doesn't play games, you know? He has too much character and integrity." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Ah ha. And what is his stand on abortion?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="What?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="What is his stand...on abortion?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Well, I'm sure he's pro-choice." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="How do you know?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Because he, well...he's just so good-looking." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Well, you should probably ask, because if he's gonna be coming over with those Paccino's pizzas...could be trouble." name="JERRY" /><sd>George at a video store counter.</sd><char dialog="I'd like to rent Breakfast At Tiffany's." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Uh, this is out.

We can't do that." name="CLERK" /><char dialog="Well, maybe they're done with it. I could go pick it up." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I don't think so.
