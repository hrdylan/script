<root><char dialog="Written by Larry David, Jerry Seinfeld &amp; Matt Goldman" name="THE STRANDED" /><set>(Comedy club)</set><sd>So I was in the drug store the other day, trying to get a cold medication. You</sd><sd>ever try and pick one of these out? It's not easy. It's a wall. It's an</sd><sd>entire wall of cold medication, you stand there, you're going, "Alright,</sd><sd>alright, alright, okay, what the hell-- This is quick acting, but this is long</sd><sd>lasting. When do I need to feel good, now or later?" It's a tough question.</sd><sd>And they always show you the commercials on TV where they show you what's wrong</sd><sd>with the guy, you know? They always show you, like, all the problems that he's</sd><sd>having. First of all, the always show you the human body, which is usually this</sd><sd>guy. No face, mouth open, this is how drug companies see the public. And he's</sd><sd>always in, like, a certain pain, it's like red wavy lines are going through him</sd><sd>or he's glowing, parts of him are on fire sometimes, lightning is attacking him.</sd><sd>I never had a doctor say to me, "Are you having any pain?" "Yes I am." "Are</sd><sd>you having any lightning with the pain?"</sd><sd>First scene. Jerry and George are in a drug store.</sd><char dialog="How did you get fleas?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Because my cousin's imbecile dog was rolling around outside and they" name="GEORGE" /><sd>got in his carpet.</sd><char dialog="Maybe you can get yourself a little bowtie flea collar." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="That's not funny. So, are you coming to the party?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I'd go, but Long Island, it's so far out, it smacks of desperation. The" name="JERRY" /><sd>whole party, everyone's gonna be saying to me, "You came all the way out from</sd><sd>Manhattan for this?"</sd><char dialog="You know Ava's gonna be there." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Who?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="The nice one that works in my office." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Nah." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I'll drive." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Oh, well, now you're talking." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="It's supposed to be a good party." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="What does that mean, good dip?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No, there'll be girls there." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="There's girls everywhere. I go out of my apartment, there's girls in" name="JERRY" /><sd>the elevator. They're in cafeterias, subways, so what?</sd><char dialog="There's a hundred different things here. What's the difference between" name="GEORGE" /><sd>these two? (They each grab a box and check the ingredients) You got</sd><sd>propylparabin?</sd><char dialog="Got it." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="You got isobutane-30?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I got isobutane-20." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="A-ha." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="You got sorbitant sesquioliate?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Got it." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I have aloe!" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="You got aloe?

Two women are standing at the magazine</sd><sd>rack in the background.</sd><char dialog="Girls. There's girls right here in the store. Look, look, there's one" name="JERRY" /><sd>over there. Look, there's another one. Soon as I walk outside there'll be</sd><sd>girls out there. What's the matter?</sd><char dialog="I gave her a twenty, she only gave me change for a ten." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Are you sure? Oh boy, here we go." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Excuse me, I gave you a twenty dollar bill and you" name="GEORGE" /><sd>only actually gave me change for a ten.</sd><char dialog="You gave me a ten." name="CASHIER" /><char dialog="I'm positive I gave you a twenty." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I know what you gave me." name="CASHIER" /><char dialog="You owe me ten dollars." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Will you please step aside? Next?" name="CASHIER" /><char dialog="Alright, let's just examine the situation for a second. Who, in this" name="GEORGE" /><sd>situation, would be more likely to make a mistake? Me, who had access to my</sd><sd>wallet, knew exactly what was in there? Or you--</sd><char dialog="You." name="CASHIER" /><char dialog="No, no, no, see you're not really listening." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="What's the problem here?" name="SECURITY GUARD" /><char dialog="No problem. There's no problem. She just owes me ten dollars, that's" name="GEORGE" /><sd>all.</sd><char dialog="He's claiming short." name="CASHIER" /><char dialog="Alright, let's just take it outside." name="SECURITY GUARD" /><char dialog="Oh, so you don't believe me either?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Come on, let's go." name="SECURITY GUARD" /><char dialog="You haven't won. You may think you've won, but you haven't won. Do" name="GEORGE" /><sd>you know why? It's not over. This is not over. I'm not forgetting what's</sd><sd>happening here. You have my ten dollars. I will get it back. Alright, don't</sd><sd>worry. It's not over. I'm going now. Good bye. I will be back.</sd><sd>New scene. George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door</sd><char dialog="" name="." /><char dialog="Well don't stand here, let's walk in, blend in, blend in." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="No, let's survey first. Camp here." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Eva." name="GEORGE" /><sd>A beautiful woman starts walking over.</sd><char dialog="What could possess anyone to throw a party? I mean, to have a bunch of" name="JERRY" /><sd>strangers treat your house like a hotel room.</sd><char dialog="So, guess who just sold 129 West 81st." name="AVA" /><char dialog="Oh no you didn't. Get out, when?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Yesterday" name="AVA" /><char dialog="I don't believe it." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Ask Mark." name="AVA" /><char dialog="Mark, is this true?" name="GEORGE" /><sd>A man across the room nods. George and Ava walk towards him.</sd><char dialog="Yeah, this has got disaster written all over it." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="How did I ever let you talk me into this, I must have been out of my" name="ELAINE" /><sd>mind.</sd><char dialog="Now listen, let's keep an eye on each other tonight. In case one of us" name="JERRY" /><sd>gets in a bad conversation, we should have a signal that you're in trouble so</sd><sd>the other one can get us out of it.</sd><char dialog="How old are you?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Thirty-six. What's the signal? Howbout this? Chicken wing? No, no," name="JERRY" /><sd>no, I got a better one. Head patting.</sd><char dialog="Whatever you want." name="ELAINE" /><sd>Fast forward a bit, Jerry is sitting on the couch with a stranger.</sd><char dialog="You came all the way out from Manhattan for this?" name="GUY" /><char dialog="Yeah, yeah I did." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="So what do you do?" name="GUY" /><char dialog="I'm a comedian." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Are you? Lemme ask you something. Where do you get your material?" name="GUY" /><char dialog="I hear a voice." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="What kind of voice?" name="GUY" /><char dialog="A man's voice, but he speaks in German so I have to get a translator." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="How come you keep tapping your head." name="GUY" /><char dialog="It's a nervous tic. I'm on L-Dopa." name="JERRY" /><sd>Cut to Elaine, engaged in a conversation with another guy and patting her head.</sd><char dialog="On the other hand, you take a guy like George Washington Carver. The man" name="GUY" /><sd>devoted his whole life to the peanut. Imagine having so much passion for</sd><sd>something.</sd><sd>Cut back to Jerry and his 'guy'.</sd><char dialog="Ya know, people tell me I'm a funny guy." name="GUY" /><sd>Cut back to Elaine and her 'guy'. She's still tapping madly.</sd><char dialog="I've often wondered if he ever worked with the pecan." name="GUY" /><char dialog="Yeah, me too." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Now is that considered a nut, because I know the cashew is a legume." name="GUY" /><sd>Cut to George, now talking with Jerry.</sd><char dialog="How's it going?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Great, how about you?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I can't believe what's happening here. She hasn't taken her hands off" name="GEORGE" /><sd>me all night. She was always friendly around the office, but that was it.</sd><char dialog="How do you account for this?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I don't know, maybe a safe fell on her head." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Well, she obviously liked you all along." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No, I would have picked up on it. I can always tell when a woman likes" name="GEORGE" /><sd>me, they always somehow let you know. With me, they could torture me, I</sd><sd>wouldn't tell them. If anything I'd try to make them think I don't like them,</sd><sd>then they think, "Oh, look at this guy, he's not even looking at me, he must</sd><sd>have something going for him."</sd><char dialog="Anyway, I'm ready to go." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Now?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="If not now, when?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Gimme a half-hour." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Okay, half-hour." name="JERRY" /><sd>Cut to Elaine and the 'peanut guy'. By now, she's weary from tapping.</sd><char dialog="Peanut brittle, peanut butter, peanut oil..." name="GUY" /><char dialog="Can I talk to you for a second?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Oh, excuse me. (gets up to talk with Jerry) What have you been doing," name="ELAINE" /><sd>I've been smacking myself senseless. People think I'm a mental patient.</sd><char dialog="Hey, I was dying over there." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="This guy's going off on the peanut. Now pay attention." name="ELAINE" /><sd>Fast forward a bit, a woman (Ellen) is talking to Jerry.</sd><char dialog="Yeah, I think I've seen you in a club. You talk about a lot of every" name="ELLEN" /><sd>day things, right?</sd><char dialog="Right." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah, I remember you." name="ELLEN" /><sd>Ellen turns her back and the camera pans out to Elaine, sitting on the couch</sd><sd>near a pretentious woman.</sd><char dialog="I wonder what happened to my fianc&#233;. I know he's here somewhere." name="WOMAN" /><sd>Ellen? Have you seen my fianc&#233;?</sd><char dialog="He's upstairs." name="ELLEN" /><char dialog="Are you going upstairs? Tell my fianc&#233; I'm looking for him. I have" name="WOMAN" /><sd>lost my fianc&#233;, the poor baby.</sd><char dialog="Maybe the dingo ate your baby." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="What?" name="WOMAN" /><char dialog="The dingo ate your baby!" name="ELAINE" /><sd>Cut to George and Jerry.</sd><char dialog="You ready?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Listen, I have a tremendous favor to ask." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I do favors." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I think something's happening here." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="What?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I think she wants me to take her home." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Wow." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="What should I do?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Go! What could you do?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="What about you and Elaine?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="We'll get a ride." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Are you sure?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="We'll be fine, what did she say?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="She told me she wants-- (Pauses until a woman coming down the stairs" name="GEORGE" /><sd>passes) She told me she wants me to make love to her.</sd><char dialog="What? She said that?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Get out of here." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I swear." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="What did you say?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I, I, I can't." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="What did you say?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Please, it's--" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="What?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I... I... I long for you." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I long for you?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I was so shocked I was lucky I said anything." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="It's okay, that's not bad." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I don't like when a woman says, 'Make love to me', it's intimidating." name="GEORGE" /><sd>The last time a woman said that to me, I wound up apologizing to her.</sd><char dialog="Really?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="That's a lot of pressure. Make love to me. What am I, in the circus?" name="GEORGE" /><sd>What if I can't deliver?</sd><char dialog="Oh, come on." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I can't perform under pressure. That's why I never play anything for" name="GEORGE" /><sd>money, I choke. I could choke tonight. And she works in my office, can you</sd><sd>imagine? She goes around telling everyone what happened? Maybe I should</sd><sd>cancel, I have a very bad feeling about this.</sd><char dialog="George, you're thinking too much." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I know, I know, I can't stop it!" name="GEORGE" /><sd>Cut to Elaine, talking with yet another guy on the couch.</sd><char dialog="Well, right now I'm reading manuscripts for Pendant Publishing." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Pendant? Those bastards." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Excuse me." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Listen, George is going home with this Ava from his office" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Really? Huh. What a world. So we can go now?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Uh, no, he's taking the car." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Well, what are we gonna do for a ride?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="I don't know." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="You don't know?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Maybe Kramer can come pick us up." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Oh great, oh, this is great. How could you let him take the car?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="There's nothing I could do, it's part of the code." name="JERRY" /><sd>Mid-episode monologue</sd><sd>All plans between men are tentative. If one man should suddenly have an</sd><sd>opportunity to pursue a woman, it's like these two guys never met each other</sd><sd>ever in life. This is the male code. And it doesn't matter how important the</sd><sd>arrangements are, I mean, most of the time when they scrub a space shuttle</sd><sd>mission it's because one of the astronauts met someone on his way to the launch</sd><sd>pad. They hold that countdown. He's leaning against the rocket talking to her,</sd><sd>"So listen, when I get back what do you say we get together for some Tang?"</sd><char dialog="Oh look at that. Look at what she's wearing." name="ELAINE" /><sd>You see what she's wearing?</sd><char dialog="Yeah, yeah, alright." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I can't believe she's walking around in that." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Just don't make a scene." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Hey, is that real fur?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Oh boy." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="It better be or my ex-husband owes me an explanation." name="EVA" /><char dialog="Yeah, good night." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="You don't care that innocent defenseless animals are being tortured so" name="ELAINE" /><sd>that you can look good?</sd><char dialog="Could we talk about this some other time?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Are you a vegetarian?" name="AVA" /><char dialog="Here we go." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah, I eat fish occasionally." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="So you're a hypocrite." name="AVA" /><char dialog="Hey, I've eaten frogs, so nobody's perfect. Anyway-" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Well, talk to me when you stop eating fish." name="AVA" /><char dialog="Fish don't feel any pain." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="How do you know? Do you communicate with fish?" name="AVA" /><char dialog="Well, they're not kept in little cages." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Ever seen a goldfish?" name="AVA" /><char dialog="Goldfish." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Yeah, yeah I've seen goldfish. They're not unhappy." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Oh yeah, right. Swim around in a bowl for two weeks and get flushed down" name="AVA" /><sd>the toilet, that's a good life. (To George) Let's go.</sd><char dialog="Oh yeah, that's right. Go ahead, go ahead, maybe you can run over a" name="ELAINE" /><sd>squirrel!</sd><char dialog="That's why we're here in America." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="You're beautiful." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Call Kramer." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Alright. (Approaches host) Excuse me, this is your party, right?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No, I just live here." name="STEVE" /><char dialog="Can I use your phone?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="What's in it for me?" name="STEVE" /><char dialog="A bigger bill?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="He he, go for it." name="STEVE" /><sd>Jerry picks up the phone and dials.</sd><char dialog="Krame? Sein. What are you doing? Well, I'm stuck out here on Long" name="JERRY" /><sd>Island. What are your thoughts about taking a ride? You sure? Okay, but don't</sd><sd>leave me hanging here. Okay, great. Let me give you directions.</sd><sd>Cut to several hours later. The party has ended. The hosts, Steve and Jenny,</sd><sd>are cleaning up, Elaine and Jerry are still there.</sd><char dialog="You sure you don't need any help?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="No, not really." name="JENNY" /><char dialog="I'm sure he'll be here any minute." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I want them out of here." name="JENNY" /><char dialog="Call him again." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="I called, what should I do? (To Jenny) We really appreciate this." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="It's two o'clock in the morning." name="JENNY" /><char dialog="Oh, you got the Civil War book. I saw" name="JERRY" /><sd>some of that show, it was wonderful.</sd><char dialog="Six hundred and twenty million people died." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Thousand." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Thousand. Six hundred and twenty thousand. The horror, the horror." name="ELAINE" /><sd>(To Jerry) The wife keeps giving us dirty looks. Are you sure you gave him the</sd><sd>right directions?</sd><char dialog="Yes. (To Jenny) You're sure there's nothing we can do?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No! (To Steve) I am not going to bed with them in out house, this is" name="JENNY" /><sd>ridiculous.</sd><char dialog="You know a friend of my father's used to live right around here. Mike" name="JERRY" /><sd>Wichter. He sold plastic straws. You know the ones? You could bend them.</sd><char dialog="Have you noticed, people don't use straws as much as they used to for" name="ELAINE" /><sd>some reason.</sd><char dialog="You know, it doesn't look as if your friend is coming." name="JENNY" /><char dialog="Oh, he's coming." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Maybe you should take a look at a train schedule." name="JENNY" /><sd>Jenny sees a figure outside the kitchen window and screams.</sd><char dialog="That's him." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I'm going to bed!" name="JENNY" /><char dialog="Thanks a lot." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Thanks, great party." name="JERRY" /><sd>As Jenny storms up the stairs there's a knock at the door, Steve answers.</sd><char dialog="Hey, how ya doing?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Ah, look who's here." name="STEVE" /><char dialog="I'm sorry." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Hey, it's okay." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I had the directions on the seat right next to me, they flew out the" name="KRAMER" /><sd>window.</sd><char dialog="Then how did you find the place?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Well I knew the exit on the Long Island Expressway, and I thought that" name="KRAMER" /><sd>the address was 8713 Riviera Drive. Uh uh, so I drove around knocking on</sd><sd>everybody's doors that had those numbers; 8317, 7813, 3718, 1837, whoo.</sd><sd>Finally, I hit it. 8173.</sd><char dialog="Anyway, thanks a lot for letting us stay here, Steve, I really owe you" name="JERRY" /><sd>one.</sd><char dialog="No problem." name="STEVE" /><char dialog="And if you're ever in the city, you know, you want to come to a comedy" name="JERRY" /><sd>club, whatever.</sd><char dialog="Hey, I might take you up on that." name="STEVE" /><char dialog="Here's my address and number. And really, thanks again." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="You better zip up. I couldn't get the top on the" name="KRAMER" /><sd>convertible up.</sd><char dialog="But it's cold out." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Yeah, wait till we get on the Expressway." name="KRAMER" /><sd>New scene. Jerry's at his apartment, talking on the phone.</sd><char dialog="George, I've been sick all week. Elaine was too. Eighty miles an hour," name="JERRY" /><sd>forty degree temperature for fifty minutes. Do the math. Yeah, maybe I will</sd><sd>get out. Hey, let me just stop off at the drug store first. Okay, meet me down</sd><sd>there in fifteen minutes then we'll go do something. Yeah, Selwyn's. Okay bye.</sd><sd>Jerry hangs up and grabs his coat and there's a knock at the door.</sd><char dialog="Who is it?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Mr. Pocatello." name="VOICE" /><char dialog="Who?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="You mean you don't recognize my voice?" name="VOICE" /><sd>Jerry opens the door. Steve steps in.</sd><char dialog="Jerry, baby!" name="STEVE" /><char dialog="Do I know you?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Boy this comedy's really frying your brain." name="STEVE" /><char dialog="I'm sorry, uh-" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="See, this is the kind of lasting impression I make on people." name="STEVE" /><char dialog="Oh, okay." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="You said if I was ever in the city, I'm in the city." name="STEVE" /><char dialog="You certainly are. What's going on?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I'm just waiting for a lift back to the island, he won't be ready until" name="STEVE" /><sd>eleven, so I figured I'd give you a break. I thought I'd see what it was like</sd><sd>to hang out with someone in show business.</sd><char dialog="Listen, I'm really sorry but I'm just on my way out to meet a friend." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Oh, come on, you can come up with something better than that." name="STEVE" /><char dialog="No, really, I just got off the phone with him." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I understand." name="STEVE" /><char dialog="Look, you can hang out here if you want." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Don't be so enthusiastic." name="STEVE" /><char dialog="No, it's-" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I'm not gonna steal anything." name="STEVE" /><char dialog="No, of course not, just close the door when you leave." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I think I can do that." name="STEVE" /><char dialog="Really, I'm sorry. Maybe another time." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah. Let's have lunch." name="STEVE" /><sd>New scene. Jerry and George are at the drug store.</sd><char dialog="They guy's in my house right now. What a mistake that party was, I" name="JERRY" /><sd>never should have gone.</sd><char dialog="Yeah, me either." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Oh, come on." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="What come on? Have you ever dated a woman that worked in your office?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I've never had a job." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="You know the anxiety you feel on a date? That's what I have every day" name="GEORGE" /><sd>now. My worst nightmare's come true, every day is a date.</sd><char dialog="That's one of Dante's nine stages of hell, isn't it?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Ava was one of the reasons I used to like going to work, she was a" name="GEORGE" /><sd>friend. Now we sleep together and suddenly, I don't know how to talk to her.</sd><sd>Every time I go to the bathroom I pass her desk. I have to plan little patter.</sd><sd>I spend half my day writing. Then afterwards, I sit in my office and analyze</sd><sd>how it went. If it was a good conversation, I don't go to the bathroom for the</sd><sd>rest of the day. I see her laughing and talking with other people, they're all</sd><sd>so loose and relaxed, I think, 'that used to be me. I want to go back there</sd><sd>again.'</sd><char dialog="What are you gonna do?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I have no choice, I'm quitting." name="GEORGE" /><sd>Cut back to Steve sitting alone on Jerry's couch watching TV. Kramer walks in</sd><sd>and it takes a moment for him to recognize the visitor.</sd><char dialog="The party, Long Island?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Kramer, right?" name="STEVE" /><char dialog="Hey, what are you doing here?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="I'm waiting for my ride." name="STEVE" /><char dialog="Where's Jerry?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="He split. Let me ask you something. Is there anything to drink in here" name="STEVE" /><sd>or is that, like, a stupid question?</sd><char dialog="Well, Jerry, he doesn't have anything. (Sensing Steve's" name="KRAMER" /><sd>disappointment) Well, but I might have something.</sd><sd>Cut back to Jerry and George at the drugstore. Jerry is selecting medication.</sd><char dialog="Alright, I'm gonna get this. This looks good." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="How much is that?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Nine sixty." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Nine sixty? Give it to me." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Why?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Don't worry, I got it." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="What do you mean, you got it?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I got it." name="GEORGE" /><sd>George takes the box and begins to place it in his jacket.</sd><char dialog="Since when are you treating me to medicine? What are you doing? You're" name="JERRY" /><sd>stealing this, aren't you?</sd><char dialog="I'm not stealing it. They owe me ten dollars. They stole from me." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="You're a lunatic." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I have to do this, it's a matter of honor." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="What do you say to a person like you?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Just walk." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Oh." name="JERRY" /><sd>A security guard approaches George.</sd><char dialog="Scuse me. What do you got there?" name="SECURITY GUARD" /><char dialog="What?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="What do you got in your shirt?" name="SECURITY GUARD" /><char dialog="Oh, I was gonna pay for this." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="" name="SECURITY GUARD" /><sd>Come with me.</sd><char dialog="Where are you taking me?

Are you gonna call the police?" name="GEORGE" /><sd>The Security Guard drags George away and Jerry steps to the counter.</sd><char dialog="Can I still buy this or is this evidence now?" name="JERRY" /><sd>Cut back to Kramer and Steve, they're obviously tanked. Kramer is in the middle</sd><sd>of a story.</sd><char dialog="So, I'm chasing these doves down the street and she's screaming at the" name="KRAMER" /><sd>top of her lungs, and then when the magician comes back from Europe, two of them</sd><sd>turned brown! Well I followed the instructions!</sd><sd>They both erupt in raucous laughter.</sd><char dialog="Ah, they turned brown!! Brown!!
