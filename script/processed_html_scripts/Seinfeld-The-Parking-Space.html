If I want my ass hanging out of</sd><sd>the back of my parking spot, that's my business. There are people out there</sd><sd>with real asses hanging out of their pants, nobody's stopping them. Nobody</sd><sd>goes, "Hey, hold it, sir. Those are compact jeans, you can't pull that in</sd><sd>there."</sd><sd>Jerry is in his apartment, Kramer enters.</sd><char dialog="Hey.

I don't think so." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Well, please?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Not today, pal." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Okay, I beg you." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Now see? Just saying beg doesn't make it a real beg. You gotta put" name="JERRY" /><sd>some beg into it.</sd><char dialog="Okay, please! Please tell me!" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Alright, I'll tell you, but your begging needs a lot of work." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Okay, okay, what is it? Come on." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="I loaned the car to George." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Ah, George, alright. Well, what for?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="George and Elaine went to a flea market in Westchester, okay?!" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Alright." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Huh?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Huh. I mean, what do they want to go there for?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Will you stop it already?!" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="You know, why didn't they ask me to go?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="I don't know!

Oh yeah." name="KRAMER" /><sd>George and Elaine are in Jerry's car. George is wearing a new hat.</sd><char dialog="I really think it looks good." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Ten bucks, how can you go wrong?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="All bald people look good in hats." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="You should have lived in the twenties and thirties, you know men wore" name="ELAINE" /><sd>hats all the time then.</sd><char dialog="What a bald paradise that must have been. Nobody knew." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Well, you can wear a hat all the time now. Who's stopping you?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="No, I can't. What if I meet a woman? I'd always be worried about that" name="GEORGE" /><sd>first moment where I'd take it off and see that look of disappointment on her</sd><sd>face.</sd><char dialog="Are you sure you like these sunglasses?" name="ELAINE" /><sd>Elaine moves the rear view mirror so she can check out her sunglasses and this</sd><sd>causes George to swerve and hit something.</sd><sd>Cut back to Kramer and Jerry at Jerry's apartment.</sd><char dialog="Well I'm very disappointed in George and Elaine. And you know I'm" name="KRAMER" /><sd>somebody you don't want to have on your bad side.</sd><char dialog="Why not?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Because I'm like ice, buddy. When I don't like you, you've got" name="KRAMER" /><sd>problems. (notices some snacks on the table) Oh, is this for the fight?</sd><char dialog="Yep. (checks watch) Starts in thirty-five minutes." name="JERRY" /><sd>Kramer and Jerry start 'sparring'.</sd><char dialog="Oh hey, you know I invited Mike Moffit. You don't mind, do you?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="No, I like Mike." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah, I just got off the phone with him, you know we had a great" name="KRAMER" /><sd>conversation.</sd><char dialog="Oh yeah? What did you talk about?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Well actually we talked about you. Yeah. He had some pretty" name="KRAMER" /><sd>interesting things to say.</sd><char dialog="Oh yeah? What did he say?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="You have to know everything, don't you?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="No, come on, Kramer. What did he say?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Why is that? Why do you have to know everything?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Kramer, just tell me what the guy said." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Beg me." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Please, don't make me beg." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No no no, I want you to beg me. And I don't want you to say it, I just" name="KRAMER" /><sd>want you to put some beg into it. Go on.</sd><char dialog="Kramer, please tell me what the guy said." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No no no, that's no good. No, I really don't think that's a beg. No," name="KRAMER" /><sd>it's close, but uh...</sd><char dialog="Kramer!" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Look, I can't say anything. You know, the guy told me the stuff in" name="KRAMER" /><sd>confidence, I'd be betraying a friend.</sd><char dialog="Well you can't just mention it and then not tell me." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Alright. I'll tell you but you can't say anything to him." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="I'm not saying anything, I'm putting it in the vault, I'm locking the" name="JERRY" /><sd>vault, it's a vault!</sd><char dialog="He thinks you're a phony." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="He what?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I told you, he thinks you're a phony." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="A phony? He called me a phony?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="A big phone. A big one." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Why did you tell me that if I can't say anything?!" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="You begged me." name="KRAMER" /><sd>Cut back to Elaine and George in Jerry's car, the car is now making a clanking</sd><sd>noise.</sd><char dialog="Do you hear that?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Of course I hear that." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="You had to move the mirror?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I wanted to check out my sunglasses." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="I went to look in the mirror, it wasn't there. You threw off my" name="GEORGE" /><sd>equilibrium.</sd><char dialog="Oh yeah, blame it on me because you can't drive, George." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="I can't drive?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Yeah." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Nobody drives like me. Nobody. I'm doing things in this car, you have" name="GEORGE" /><sd>no idea they're going on. Wanna see me make a right turn from the left lane?</sd><sd>Watch this.</sd><char dialog="No, I really don't." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="And I can make a left turn from the right lane too." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I'm sure you could." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="What are we gonna tell Jerry about the car?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I don't know." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Alright, start looking for spaces." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Oh, you're never gonna find a space on Jerry's block, just put it in a" name="ELAINE" /><sd>garage.</sd><char dialog="Look, I have my system. First I look for the dream spot right in front" name="GEORGE" /><sd>of the door, then I slowly expand out in concentric circles.</sd><char dialog="Oh come on, George, please put it in a garage. I don't want to spend" name="ELAINE" /><sd>an hour looking for a space.</sd><char dialog="I can't park in a garage." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Why?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="I don't know, I just can't. Nobody in my family can pay for parking," name="GEORGE" /><sd>it's a sickness. My father never paid for parking; my mother, my brother,</sd><sd>nobody. We can't do it.</sd><char dialog="I'll pay for it." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="You don't understand. A garage. I can't even pull in there. It's" name="GEORGE" /><sd>like going to a prostitute. Why should I pay, when if I apply myself, maybe I</sd><sd>could get it for free? (he hears a horn honking) What? What do you want? Go</sd><sd>around me, I'm looking for spaces.</sd><char dialog="Oh George, there's a space right there!" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Oh beautiful! Look at that, the dream" name="GEORGE" /><sd>space right in front of Jerry's building. Huh? Dreams can come true, what did</sd><sd>I tell you?</sd><char dialog="You didn't even have to take it out to dinner." name="ELAINE" /><sd>They share a laugh.</sd><char dialog="Alright, now you're gonna see some parallel parking. (spitting into" name="GEORGE" /><sd>his hands and rubbing them together) How I wish you could make a living</sd><sd>parallel parking. (turning around in his seat) It's all geometry, knowing all</sd><sd>the angles, when to make that first turn and then when to swing it back in,</sd><sd>that's the key.</sd><char dialog="Will you just park it already?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="There's nothing I can even impart to you, that's the sad thing. It's" name="GEORGE" /><sd>so inborn, I can't pass it on. (begins backing into the space) Look at this</sd><sd>guy. Are you crazy, what are you doing?! Hey! Hey, you're stealing my space!</sd><char dialog="George, wait, you don't know who this guy is, people kill for a parking" name="ELAINE" /><sd>space in this city.</sd><char dialog="No no no, he's not getting away with this." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="George?" name="ELAINE" /><sd>George gets out of the car to confront the other driver.</sd><char dialog="Hey, what are you doing?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I think I'm parking my car." name="MIKE" /><char dialog="You can't do that, you can't just sneak in from the back like that." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I'm not sneaking. I didn't even know you were parking, you were just" name="MIKE" /><sd>sitting there three spaces up.</sd><char dialog="Well if you didn't think I was parking, why did you put it in head" name="GEORGE" /><sd>first?</sd><char dialog="Well that's the way I park. Anyway, you didn't start backing in until I" name="MIKE" /><sd>pulled in.</sd><char dialog="I was in the middle of a conversation." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Hey, buddy, what can I tell you?" name="MIKE" /><char dialog="The point is I was here first." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I was closer to this space than you were." name="MIKE" /><char dialog="But I'm backing in! You can't put it in head first!" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I can if I have room!" name="MIKE" /><char dialog="Are you gonna move the car?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="No, I'm not gonna move the car." name="MIKE" /><char dialog="Jerk!" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Oh, you're not?" name="MIKE" /><char dialog="Do you believe this guy?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Come on, we'll put it in a garage." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="I am not putting it in a garage, it's my space." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="What are you gonna do, you just gonna leave it here like this? Uh." name="ELAINE" /><sd>I'm going upstairs.</sd><char dialog="Are you coming back down?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Yeah, I gotta tell Jerry we're here. I gotta go to the bathroom." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Alright, just make sure he reserves the good chair for me. Wait, what" name="GEORGE" /><sd>are you gonna tell him about the clanking noise in the car?</sd><char dialog="Me? No no no, you. You're gonna tell him. I'm not gonna tell- Noo." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Oh, come on, you're good at this." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="What am I gonna say?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="I don't know, I don't know, you'll think of something." name="GEORGE" /><sd>Elaine heads upstairs. Mike honks his horn, George honks his in retaliation.</sd><sd>Cut to Jerry's apartment. Jerry is moving chairs, Elaine bursts in.</sd><char dialog="Oh god, I need a drink, do you got any Hennigan's here?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Yeah, under the counter. What happened?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Oh god. Oh, Jerry it was so terrible what we just went through on the" name="ELAINE" /><sd>way home. (pouring a big shot of scotch) You wouldn't believe it. (pushing a</sd><sd>bag of chips off the counter)</sd><char dialog="Tell me what happened." name="JERRY" /><sd>Elaine (after pouring the shot in the sink while Jerry was distracted and</sd><sd>the Henry Hudson Parkway, okay?! And there were these, like, this pack of</sd><sd>extremely wild teenagers in a convertible behind us, okay?! And for some</sd><sd>reason, I don't know, they just started to taunt us! And so then we payed the</sd><sd>toll, and then we went through, and then they started to follow us, alright?!</sd><sd>So George tries to lose them, and, and, but they were in this really like a</sd><sd>souped up car, you know?! And so he turned off the road really suddenly and the</sd><sd>car was on two wheels and I was just screaming! And then, George is such a</sd><sd>great driver.</sd><char dialog="He is?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Oh, he is fantastic! And then they fired a gun right up in the air." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="A gun?!" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I think it was a gun. And then they followed us all the way into the" name="ELAINE" /><sd>city, and then they just stopped and they turned around and they went home.</sd><char dialog="My god, are you okay?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah, yeah, I'm alright. Oh, by the way, the car hit a pothole and now" name="ELAINE" /><sd>it's making a clanking noise.</sd><char dialog="Well, I mean, as long as you're okay, that, that's the important thing." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Exactly." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Where's George now?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Oh, he's out in front of the building. He's arguing with some guy" name="ELAINE" /><sd>about a parking space.</sd><char dialog="What are you talking about?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Look out the window, you'll see." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Hey Georgie!" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Hey!" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Are you okay?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah, I'm fine." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Crazy kids, huh?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="What?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Ow!! (Jerry looks over) It's my cuticle." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Is that Jerry? Jerry?!" name="MIKE" /><char dialog="Oh, hey Mike." name="JERRY" /><sd>George What, you know Jerry?</sd><char dialog="Yeah, I know Jerry." name="MIKE" /><char dialog="How do you know him?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="What's the difference?" name="MIKE" /><char dialog="Because I know him too, and probably a lot better than you." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Well, bully for you. Hey, Jerry! You know your friend here's a real" name="MIKE" /><sd>piece of work!</sd><char dialog="I'm coming down." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Hey, will you tell Kramer I'm outside?" name="MIKE" /><sd>George, What, you know Kramer?!</sd><sd>Kramer walks into Jerry's apartment.</sd><char dialog="Hi." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Hello." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Hey, your friend Mike's outside, he wants to talk to you." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Hey, Mike! Come on up, the fight's almost starting!" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="And you're watching the fight at Jerry's?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Yeah." name="MIKE" /><char dialog="Oh great." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="You know that guy downstairs?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Yeah, he's a real phony." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="What's going on?!" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Hey, will you come on down? This guy's in my space!" name="MIKE" /><char dialog="It's my space!" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I'll be down in a minute." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Are you going down?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Yeah." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Is anything wrong?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Why should anything be wrong?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Be down in a minute." name="ELAINE" /><sd>Jerry grabs his jacket and walks out the door.</sd><char dialog="Hey pal, you're not getting that space. I mean, I'll sleep in my car if" name="MIKE" /><sd>I have to.</sd><char dialog="I'll die out here." name="GEORGE" /><sd>Two bystanders are discussing the incident.</sd><char dialog="He was down there. Once he passed his front bumper, it's no" name="BYSTANDER #1" /><sd>longer his space.</sd><char dialog="No, it doesn't matter. He was-" name="BYSTANDER #2" /><char dialog="Hey! Jerry! Long time no see!" name="MIKE" /><char dialog="Hi Mike. (Noticing George's fedora) Indiana." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Hey Krame! You know this guy?" name="MIKE" /><char dialog="Yeah, yeah, I know him." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="You're looking tremendous. What are you on some kind of" name="MIKE" /><sd>regimen?</sd><char dialog="Yeah, twenty-five percent bran flakes. The forty percent was too much" name="JERRY" /><sd>so I found a store to mix it up special for me, they take it down another</sd><sd>fifteen percent.</sd><char dialog="Ha ha ha ha!!! That's killer! Killer!" name="MIKE" /><sd>I love that! Ha ha ha!!! You gotta use that, that's a definite!! Ha ha ha!!!</sd><char dialog="Oh, come on." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Hey! Your friend here has some real problems." name="MIKE" /><char dialog="Me? You see what he did here, you see how he tried to sneak into my" name="GEORGE" /><sd>space?</sd><char dialog="Hey, just 'cause I went in front first doesn't mean I'm sneaking in." name="MIKE" /><char dialog="You only went in front first 'cause you saw me backing up and you" name="GEORGE" /><sd>didn't have room to parallel park!</sd><char dialog="I only went in front first 'cause I could make it in front first and if" name="MIKE" /><sd>you pull out I'll show you!</sd><char dialog="You've got a prayer." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I go in front first all the time." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Front first, that's how you park when you're pulling a bank job." name="JERRY" /><sd>Elaine shows up and pulls George aside.</sd><char dialog="Did you talk to him?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Yeah, it's all taken care of." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="You told him? What did you tell him?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I did a number on him, it was a thing of beauty, you really had to have" name="ELAINE" /><sd>been there to appreciate it.</sd><char dialog="I don't believe it, what did you say?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I told him a pack of teenagers in a convertible were terrorizing us and" name="ELAINE" /><sd>they followed us into the city.</sd><char dialog="A pack of teenagers?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Yeah, by the time I got to the end of the story, he was to relieved" name="ELAINE" /><sd>that we were alive he couldn't care less about the car.</sd><char dialog="You are a genius, it's as simple as that." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="What can I say, you know? It's a gift. I only wish I could teach it" name="ELAINE" /><sd>but, you know it's inborn.</sd><sd>Elaine and George rejoin the others.</sd><char dialog="By the way, thanks a lot for inviting me to the flea market." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="What?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Yeah, Jerry, he told me all about it." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Oh great." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I didn't know." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Oh, so that's why you were acting so funny." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Well I didn't know you wanted to go to the flea market." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="A flea market? You went to a flea market??" name="MIKE" /><char dialog="Hey, who's talking to you?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="We just didn't think of you." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="You said it, sister." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="What? Every time I leave my house now I have to call everybody I know" name="GEORGE" /><sd>and ask them if they want to do what I'm doing?</sd><sd>People forget. Look at "Home Alone". They forgot.</sd><char dialog="Great move, telling him, by the way, real smart move." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I didn't know I wasn't supposed to say anything!" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Judgement, Jerry, judgement! You exercised no judgement." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="You're right. My fault." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Kramer? I'm so sorry, really." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Yeah, I'm sorry." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I'm sorry, I don't care for that sorry." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="What was wrong with that sorry? It was a good sorry. Jerry, was that" name="GEORGE" /><sd>a good sorry?</sd><char dialog="It was a so-so sorry." name="JERRY" /><sd>A delivery truck pulls up and honks. The driver leans out of the cab.</sd><char dialog="Hey! Move this car, I gotta get through!" name="TRUCK DRIVER" /><char dialog="You heard the man. I guess you gotta be moving your car." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="And like you're not gonna just back it in if I do that?" name="MIKE" /><char dialog="Well somebody better move something soon! I got a truck full of" name="TRUCK DRIVER" /><sd>ice cream here!</sd><sd>Fade out/in.</sd><char dialog="You see, they had to move the cars so the truck could get through," name="ELAINE" /><sd>right? But these guys don't trust each other so they got these two nonpartisan</sd><sd>drivers to move them.</sd><char dialog="Wild pack of teenagers, huh?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Amazing how they picked you, out of everyone, to terrorize." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah. I know, I said to myself, 'Why us?' You remember?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Uh huh." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Sounds like you did some pretty nifty maneuvering," name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Well, you know, It's interesting, you know, under that pressure, what" name="GEORGE" /><sd>you're capable of.</sd><char dialog="Right." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="I learned a lot about myself." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="What did you do to my car?!" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I couldn't help it! Elaine moved the mirror, I got discombobulated." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Oh, like you've ever been bobulated." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="I thought you said you were a good driver!" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No no, I never said I was a good driver, I said I was a good parker." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I think you said driver." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Parker, I never said driver, I said parker, a great parker." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Will you move it up a little bit?" name="MIKE" /><char dialog="No no no, that's in the right position." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="No no, I was further in." name="MIKE" /><char dialog="No you weren't. Stop there, that's fine." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Do you mind?" name="MIKE" /><char dialog="Do you?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Hey, somebody better move these cars, you're making a commotion." name="SID" /><char dialog="Hey Sid." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Who are you?" name="MIKE" /><char dialog="Never mind who I am. I know who I am. Do you know who you are? (to" name="SID" /><sd>George) Why is it every time you park a car in this block, everything gets</sd><sd>disrupted and disjointed?</sd><char dialog="Sid, it's completely his fault." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Oh, right." name="MIKE" /><char dialog="Why don't you start taking the bus?" name="SID" /><char dialog="Okay, George. Come on, let's go. I'm putting it in a garage. The" name="JERRY" /><sd>fight's starting in two minutes.</sd><char dialog="Don't do it!" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="What are we gonna do, stay out here all night?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yes! I'm not giving him the satisfaction, it's my space." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Why don't you just flip a coin already?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="No no, this is a matter of principle. That would just be saying that" name="GEORGE" /><sd>anybody could just pull into any parking space any way they want. Well I'm</sd><sd>making a stand here. I'm saying *no* to head first parking. I'm not putting up</sd><sd>with that. We put up with too much crap in this city, we're not putting up with</sd><sd>head first parking.</sd><char dialog="You know, maybe if you hadn't been sitting there pontificating about" name="ELAINE" /><sd>what a great parker you were, you might have got the space.</sd><char dialog="So you're against me now?" name="GEORGE" /><sd>An old man and Matthew, the boy who's father owns the 'fat free' frozen yogurt</sd><sd>store, are discussing the incident.</sd><char dialog="He could have pulled up to the car and backed in, but he chose to go" name="ANGRY MAN" /><sd>in head first.</sd><char dialog="No he couldn't, because the other car was already backing in." name="MATTHEW" /><char dialog="No he wasn't." name="ANGRY MAN" /><char dialog="All that matters is who was there first." name="MATTHEW" /><char dialog="Ahh, you're not even old enough to drive, you little puke." name="ANGRY MAN" /><char dialog="You just spit on me!" name="MATTHEW" /><char dialog="Don't you raise your voice to me!" name="ANGRY MAN" /><char dialog="You're not my father." name="MATTHEW" /><char dialog="Hey Matthew." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Hi Jerry. This guy's really a jerk." name="MATTHEW" /><char dialog="How ya doing?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Okay." name="MATTHEW" /><char dialog="Hey, how's your father? I hear he's closing his store." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="What?!" name="MATTHEW" /><char dialog="Oh no, nothing." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="What's happened to daddy? He's going out of business?" name="MATTHEW" /><char dialog="No, no, no, no." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="We're not going to have any money? We're out of money?" name="MATTHEW" /><char dialog="No, of course not, of course not!" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Mommy!? Jerry says daddy's closing the store.
