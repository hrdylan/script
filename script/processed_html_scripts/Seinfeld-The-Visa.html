<root><char dialog="Written by Peter Mehlman" name="THE VISA" /><set>(Comedy club)</set><sd>What are lawyers, really? To me a lawyer is basically the person that knows the</sd><sd>rules of the country. We're all throwing the dice, playing the game, moving our</sd><sd>pieces around the board, but if there's a problem, the lawyer is the only person</sd><sd>that has read the inside of the top of the box. I think one of the fun things</sd><sd>for them is to say, "objection." "Objection! Objection, your Honor."</sd><sd>Objection, of course, is the adult version of, "Fraid not." To which the judge</sd><sd>can say two things, he can say, "overruled" which is the adult version of "Fraid</sd><sd>so," or he could say, "sustained," which is the adult version of "Duh."</sd><sd>First scene. George is at the counter at Monk's, he's talking with an Oriental woman.</sd><char dialog="So you're a lawyer. What kind of cases do you handle?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Oh, everything.

Who cares?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="He thinks that if a woman sees a guy put on a better show, she'll walk" name="ELAINE" /><sd>out on his show, go see the other show.</sd><char dialog="Well, should we leave?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Maybe you don't have to be so funny. I mean, would it kill you not to" name="GEORGE" /><sd>be so funny all the time? That's all I'm asking. This woman thinks I'm very</sd><sd>funny. Now you're gonna be funny, so what am I gonna be? I'm gonna be a short</sd><sd>bald guy with glasses who suddenly doesn't seem so funny.</sd><char dialog="This is so ridiculous. Can we just go over there?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="I don't have to be funny, I don't care." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="You don't?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="No way!

Welcome back." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Sorry, it was my aunt's birthday and she makes such a big deal about" name="CHERYL" /><sd>it.</sd><char dialog="Well, nobody likes to get old, right?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Well, birthdays are merely symbolic of how another year has gone by and" name="JERRY" /><sd>how little we've grown. No matter how desperate we are that someday a better</sd><sd>self will emerge, with each flicker of the candles on the cake, we know it's not</sd><sd>to be, that for the rest of our sad, wretched pathetic lives, this is who we are</sd><sd>to the bitter end. Inevitably, irrevocably; happy birthday? No such thing.</sd><char dialog="Funny guy, huh?" name="GEORGE" /><sd>New scene. Elaine is bringing Jerry's mail to his apartment.</sd><char dialog="Here, take it. I was glad to get rid of it." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Well thank you very much, it's about time." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Oh listen, guess what? Cheryl convinced Ping to drop the case against" name="ELAINE" /><sd>me.</sd><char dialog="Drop the case? Well, congratulations, that'll save you some money." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah, no kidding. That lawyer was gonna charge me a fortune." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Oh great, a birth announcement from Arnie and" name="JERRY" /><sd>Joy Harris.</sd><sd>They hear a noise from the hallway.</sd><char dialog="Hear that? Guess who's back. (Opening the door) Hey!" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Hey." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="I thought you weren't coming back till Monday." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Well, the camp ended a few days early." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Why?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Uh, well there was an incident." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="What happened?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I punched Mickey Mantle in the mouth." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="What?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah, I punched him and they took him to the hospital and then they" name="KRAMER" /><sd>canceled the rest of the week.</sd><char dialog="You punched who in the mouth?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Mickey Mantle." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="What happened?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Well, you know, we were playing a game and, you know, I was pitching," name="KRAMER" /><sd>and I was really throwing some smoke. And Joe Pepitone, he was up, and man that</sd><sd>guy, you know, he was crowding the plate.</sd><char dialog="Wow! Joe Pepitone!" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah, well, Joe Pepitone or not, I own the inside of that plate. So I" name="KRAMER" /><sd>throw one, you know, inside, you know, a little chin music, put him right on his</sd><sd>pants. Cause I gotta intimidate when I'm on the mound. Well the next pitch,</sd><sd>he's right back in the same place. So, I had to plunk him.</sd><char dialog="You plunked him." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Oh yeah. Well, he throws down his bat, he comes racing up to the" name="KRAMER" /><sd>mound. Next thing, both benches are cleared, you know? A brouhaha breaks out</sd><sd>between the guys in the camp, you know, and the old Yankee players, and as I'm</sd><sd>trying to get Moose Skowron off of one of my teammates, you know, somebody pulls</sd><sd>me from behind, you know, and I turned around and I popped him. I looked down,</sd><sd>and woah man, it's Mickey. I punched his lights out.</sd><char dialog="Wow, this is incredible!" name="JERRY" /><sd>A voice is heard from the hallway.</sd><char dialog="Leave me alone! You can't do this to me!" name="BABU" /><char dialog="What's going on out there?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="What are you doing? This is not right, people. You're making a very bad" name="BABU" /><sd>mistake, very bad.</sd><char dialog="Babu? (leaving) I'll be right back." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah, so?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Then Hank Bauer, you know, he's screaming, &quot;Mickey! Mickey! What have" name="KRAMER" /><sd>you done with Mickey? You killed Mickey!"</sd><char dialog="So what'd you do?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Well, I got the hell out of there." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="They took Babu away!" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="They took Babu away?!" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Yeah, the Immigration guy said his Visa was expired.

I will help you, Babu, don't worry!" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Then Hank Bauer, you know, he's chasing me around, he trips over third" name="KRAMER" /><sd>base and knocks over Clete Boyer.</sd><char dialog="Uh oh." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="What?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Well this is interesting." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="What is it?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="It's a letter from the Immigration Bureau, it's Babu's Visa renewal" name="JERRY" /><sd>application form. They must have put it in my mailbox by mistake.</sd><char dialog="Well, doesn't he need that?" name="KRAMER" /><sd>New scene. Jerry and Elaine are at Jerry's apartment.</sd><char dialog="If you had given me my mail last week when I got home, this whole thing" name="JERRY" /><sd>never would have happened.</sd><char dialog="Well, you should have come to my house to pick it up." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Yeah, so am I being funny now?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No, actually, you're not being funny now." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="See, I told you I wasn't funny all the time. (George enters) Hey" name="JERRY" /><sd>George, look, I'm not funny now.</sd><char dialog="No, and you weren't funny last night either. In fact, you got us both" name="GEORGE" /><sd>so depressed, she asked me to drive her home after dinner.</sd><char dialog="Oh look, I need to get in touch with Cheryl. Babu needs a lawyer, his" name="JERRY" /><sd>Visa's expired.</sd><char dialog="What do you need her for? There's a million lawyers." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Yeah, but you said this is one of the things that her firm does." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Alright, alright, but no funny business, same deal as last night." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Ah, will you stop it already?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Jerry, please?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="How long is this gonna go on?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Till I'm comfortable." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Well, when is that gonna be?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="After consummation." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Consummation?
