<root><char dialog="Written by Larry David" name="THE DOG" /><set>(Comedy club)</set><sd>So I'm on the plane, we left late. Pilot says we're going to be making up some</sd><sd>time in the air. I thought, well isn't that interesting. We'll just make up</sd><sd>time. That's why you have to reset your watch when you land. Of course, when</sd><sd>they say they're making up time, obviously they're increasing the speed of the</sd><sd>aircraft. Now, my question is if you can go faster, why don't you just go as</sd><sd>fast as you can all the time? C'mon, there's no cops up here, nail it. Give it</sd><sd>some gas! We're flying!</sd><sd>New scene. Jerry is on an airplane, seated beside a talkative (and inebriated)</sd><sd>man.</sd><char dialog="Travelling, of course, is the best education.

If aliens are watching this through telescopes, they're gonna think</sd><sd>the dogs are the leaders.
