What am I paying for? How bout' an 'I got all my luggage club'? Can I get into that club? Where is that club? I would like to join that club. Airlines love to divide us into classes.

Always gives you that look, like, maybe if you would work a little harder..." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="What time does your flight get in? Six? All right, that gives us six hours.

When you fumigated for fleas over there." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Seinfeld... Oh yeah, funny white guy, right?" name="CARL" /><char dialog="Jerry? Yes, I suppose he is white. You know, I never really thought about it. I don't see people in terms of color. You know, there's someone I'd like you to meet. Hand on...

(Morgan confused)" name="CARL" /><char dialog="That's... what we used to call him in high school, the exterminator. He's a linebacker.

Did you here about his plane in Ithaca?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="What about the plane in Ithaca?" name="EARL" /><char dialog="Oh, our stupid friend freaked out the pilot.
