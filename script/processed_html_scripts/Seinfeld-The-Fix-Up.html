<root><char dialog="Written by Larry Charles &amp; Elaine Pope" name="THE FIX-UP" /><set>(Comedy club)</set><sd>I tell ya, I never really understood the importance of the conductor. I mean</sd><sd>between you and me, what the hell is this guy doing? Do you really need</sd><sd>somebody waving a stick in your face to play the violin? Does that really help</sd><sd>you out? I could see how we need him at the beginning. Okay, tap-tap-tap,</sd><sd>start. Okay, I can see how you need that. But once we're going, okay, once</sd><sd>it's all happening, what do we need him for then? I don't see the cellist</sd><sd>looking up, go, "I'm confused. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to</sd><sd>do." And the conductor goes, "Do this. Like this" "Oh, okay, thank you very</sd><sd>much."</sd><sd>Jerry and George are seated at a table in a restaurant.</sd><char dialog="Why even try anymore? There's no sense to it. I'm never gonna meet" name="GEORGE" /><sd>anybody, I should just accept it.</sd><char dialog="Oh, yes you will." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No, I won't." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Yeah, maybe you won't." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I mean it's hard enough to meet a woman you dislike, much less like." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Are my nostrils getting bigger?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No. Why must it be so difficult? Why is there all this tension and" name="GEORGE" /><sd>hostility? Why can't I just walk up to a woman on the street and say, "Hi. I'm</sd><sd>George. How are you?" Is that so terrible?</sd><sd>Just then a beautiful woman walks past their table, George offers up a meek 'Hi'</sd><sd>which the woman ignores as she passed. George then says 'Hi' a few more times</sd><sd>as he reaches for and drinks from his water glass, as though we was saying that</sd><sd>anyway and it had nothing to do with the woman. (Funnier to watch than read.)</sd><sd>Elaine and a friend, Cynthia, are seated at a table in another restaurant.</sd><char dialog="There's just no men out there, you know?" name="CYNTHIA" /><char dialog="I know." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="I mean the problem is that the good ones know they're good. And they" name="CYNTHIA" /><sd>know they're in such demand they're just not interested in confining themselves</sd><sd>to one person.</sd><char dialog="I hate the good ones." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Is Jerry one of the good ones?" name="CYNTHIA" /><char dialog="That's a good question, I think he thinks he is." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Well, the mediocre ones are available, but they're so insecure about" name="CYNTHIA" /><sd>not being one of the good ones that they're always going, "Well I'm not good</sd><sd>enough for you, what are you doing with me?" and eventually I just go, "You're</sd><sd>right."</sd><char dialog="You know, maybe you need somebody between good and mediocre." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="No, maybe I need somebody who has nothing, somebody who just has to" name="CYNTHIA" /><sd>appreciate being with me because he's so desperate.</sd><sd>Cut back to George and Jerry, George is eating sloppily.</sd><char dialog="I mean it's gotten to the point where I'm flirting with operators on" name="GEORGE" /><sd>the phone. I almost made a date with one.</sd><char dialog="Oh, so there's still hope." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I don't want hope. Hope is killing me. My dream is to become" name="GEORGE" /><sd>hopeless. When you're hopeless, you don't care, and when you don't care, that</sd><sd>indifference makes you attractive.</sd><char dialog="Oh, so hopelessness is the key." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="It's my only hope." name="GEORGE" /><sd>Cut back to Elaine and Cynthia.</sd><char dialog="See, I wouldn't really mind so much, but I feel badly for my mother." name="CYNTHIA" /><sd>I mean, if my mother weren't around, it wouldn't be so bad. But, I'm telling</sd><sd>you, if I'm not married by the time I'm forty, I'm gonna have to kill her</sd><sd>because it's the only fair thing to do. I just couldn't put her through that.</sd><char dialog="Well, at least you're not bitter." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Who says I'm not bitter?" name="CYNTHIA" /><char dialog="Aren't you too young to be bitter?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="No, you can be young and bitter, just maybe not as bitter as I'm gonna" name="CYNTHIA" /><sd>be ten years from now, but I'm bitter. Anyway, don't tell anyone.</sd><char dialog="Don't worry, your bitterness is safe with me." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Um, order me a piece of cake. I'm gonna go throw up." name="CYNTHIA" /><sd>Jerry and Elaine are reading the newspaper at Jerry's apartment.</sd><char dialog="Look at my hands. Look. Filthy from the paper. You know, they should" name="JERRY" /><sd>give you a Wet-nap when you buy one, like at those rib joints.</sd><char dialog="So what'd you do last night?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Went out with George, you?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Went out with Cynthia." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="How was it? What'd you talk about?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Well, you know, the usual; The Federal Reserve, the rainforest." name="ELAINE" /><sd>Cynthia thought we should nuke the rainforest, you know, get rid of it in one</sd><sd>fell swoop so we can at least eliminate it as a subject of conversation. What</sd><sd>about you?</sd><char dialog="We brushed on that. Actually, George was in rare form. He just can't" name="JERRY" /><sd>find anybody.</sd><char dialog="I know, Cynthia too. She's really given up." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="George too." name="JERRY" /><sd>They look at each other for a moment.</sd><char dialog="Yeah, right." name="JERRY AND ELAINE" /><char dialog="I've never fixed anybody up." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Uh, me neither and I am not about to start with George." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Well why wouldn't you start with George? You think she's too good for" name="JERRY" /><sd>George?</sd><char dialog="I didn't say 'too good', did I say 'too good'?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Well you implied it." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I didn't say it." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Because if you think she's too good for George, you are dead wrong." name="JERRY" /><sd>Dead wrong. Who is she?</sd><char dialog="Who is he?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="He's George!" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="She's Cynthia!" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="So what?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="What, you don't think she's beautiful?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="I don't know, what's with the eyebrows?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="You know what your problem is? Your standards are too high." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="I went out with you." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="That's because my standards are too low. And by the way, you know," name="ELAINE" /><sd>women kill for eyebrows like that. Do you know that? I mean women pluck their</sd><sd>real eyebrows out of their head, one by one, until they're bald, Jerry. Bald</sd><sd>above the eyes! And then they paint in these eyebrows to look like that.</sd><char dialog="Well let me tell you something about George. He is fast. He can run" name="JERRY" /><sd>like the wind. And he's strong. I've seen him lift a hundred pounds over his</sd><sd>head without even knowing it. And you wouldn't know it to look at him, but</sd><sd>George can bait a hook.</sd><char dialog="He can really do that?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Come on, let's do it, I think they'll really get along." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="What, are you into this?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Yeah, come on, it's a good match." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No, wait a minute, wait a minute. They're gonna be telling us how" name="ELAINE" /><sd>their dates went. Are we gonna share that information?</sd><char dialog="Naturally." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Well, wait a minute, we're gonna tell each other everything, I mean" name="ELAINE" /><sd>every secret?</sd><char dialog="Everything." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="What if it worked out?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Yeah right." name="JERRY" /><sd>Jerry and George are in Jerry's apartment.</sd><char dialog="Out of the question. Out of the question!" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Why?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No! I'm not gonna do that! That's one step away from personal ads!" name="GEORGE" /><sd>And prostitutes! No! No, I am not going down that road! What does she look</sd><sd>like?</sd><char dialog="She's good looking." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="How good looking?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Very good looking." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Really good looking?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Really very good looking." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Would you take her out?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Yes, I would take her out." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Oh, you hesitated." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="What hesitate? I didn't hesitate!" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No, something's off here, you hesitated." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I'm telling you, she's good looking." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="What about the body, what kind of body?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Good body, nice body." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="How nice?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Nice." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Just nice?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Pretty nice." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Really good?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Really very nice and good." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="What about personality?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Good personality. Funny. Bright." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Smarter than me? I don't want anyone smarter than me." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="How could she be smarter than you?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Alright, let's see, let's see. What else. What else. Oh yeah, what" name="GEORGE" /><sd>does she do?</sd><sd>Elaine and Cynthia are having a similar discussion.</sd><char dialog="First of all, what does he do?" name="CYNTHIA" /><char dialog="He was in real estate, um, now, he's not working right now-" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="He's not working?! How come he's not working?" name="CYNTHIA" /><char dialog="Well, um, he, he got fired." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Why did he get fired?" name="CYNTHIA" /><char dialog="Uh. Why? Oh, right. Um, well, he tried to poison his boss." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Excuse me?" name="CYNTHIA" /><char dialog="Such a long story, Cynthia, seriously, I mean he just had some problems" name="ELAINE" /><sd>at work.</sd><char dialog="Is he nuts?" name="CYNTHIA" /><char dialog="No, no, no, he's a really really funny guy." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="What does he look like?" name="CYNTHIA" /><char dialog="Pardon?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="What does he look like?" name="CYNTHIA" /><char dialog="Um, well, he's got a lot of character in his face. Um, he's short." name="ELAINE" /><sd>Um, he's stocky.</sd><char dialog="Fat. Is that what you're saying, that he's fat?" name="CYNTHIA" /><char dialog="Powerful. He is so powerful, he can lift a hundred pounds right up" name="ELAINE" /><sd>over his head. And um, what else. What else. Oh, right. Um, well, he's kind</sd><sd>of, just kind of losing his hair.</sd><char dialog="He's bald?" name="CYNTHIA" /><char dialog="No! No, no, no, he's not bald. He's balding." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="So he will be bald." name="CYNTHIA" /><char dialog="Yup." name="ELAINE" /><sd>Cut back to Jerry and George.</sd><char dialog="What kind of hair?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="You know, long dark hair." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Flowing?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Flowing?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Is it flowing? I like flowing, cascading hair. Thick lustrous hair is" name="GEORGE" /><sd>very important to me.</sd><char dialog="'Thick lustrous hair is very important to me,' is that what you said?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah, that's right." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Just clarifying." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Let me ask you this. If you stick your hand in the hair is it easy to" name="GEORGE" /><sd>get it out?</sd><char dialog="Do you want to be able to get it out or do you want to not be able to" name="JERRY" /><sd>get it out?</sd><char dialog="I'd like to be able to get it out." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I think you'll get it out." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="What about the skin? I need a good cheek, I like a good cheek." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="She's got a fine cheek." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Is there a pinkish hue?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="A pinkish hue?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yes, a rosy glow." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="There's a hue. She's got great eyebrows, women kill to have her" name="JERRY" /><sd>eyebrows.</sd><char dialog="Who cares about eyebrows? Is she sweet? I like sweet. But not too" name="GEORGE" /><sd>sweet, you could throw up from that.</sd><char dialog="I don't think you'll throw up. *She* likes to throw up." name="JERRY" /><sd>Cut back to Elaine and Cynthia.</sd><char dialog="Has he ever been married?" name="CYNTHIA" /><char dialog="No." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Has he been close?" name="CYNTHIA" /><char dialog="He once spent a weekend with a woman." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="He didn't really try to poison his boss?" name="CYNTHIA" /><char dialog="Yeah, he did." name="ELAINE" /><sd>The next day, George is back at Jerry's.</sd><char dialog="We had an incredible phone conversation. We talked for like twenty" name="GEORGE" /><sd>minutes. I threw away my notes in the middle of the call. You know, I thought</sd><sd>she had a great voice timbre. Is it timbre or tamber?</sd><char dialog="I think it's tamber." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Why'd I think it was timbre? Yeah, she could do voiceover commercials," name="GEORGE" /><sd>why didn't you tell me about her voice?</sd><char dialog="I didn't notice the voice." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="It's mellifluous!" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="So, Saturday night." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="She had to be impressed by that conversation, had to! It was a great" name="GEORGE" /><sd>performance. I am unbelievable on the phone. On the date they should just have</sd><sd>two phones on the table at the restaurant, done.</sd><sd>Elaine enters.</sd><char dialog="Hi." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Hey! Saturday night!" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I know!" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="So, what did she say?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="She said you're getting together Saturday night!" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="That's it?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Yeah!" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="She didn't mention anything about the conversation?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="No." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Now, you see, I don't get that. We had a relaxed stimulating, great" name="GEORGE" /><sd>conversation, she doesn't mention it? Why doesn't she mention it?</sd><char dialog="What?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="She could have mentioned the conversation." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Alright, alright, I'll go on the date, but that's that." name="GEORGE" /><sd>Kramer enters.</sd><char dialog="Hey." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Hey." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="You know my friend, Bob Sacamano?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Oh, the guy from Jersey?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah. He just got a job at a condom factory in Edison. Look at this," name="KRAMER" /><sd>he gave me a gross.</sd><char dialog="What are you gonna do with all of them?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Oh, well... Come on, take some, Jerry. Grab 'em." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="No thanks, they look like they came out of a cereal box." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Come on, Elaine, here, take half a bag." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Half a bag? What am I, a hooker? Anyway, they look kind of cheap." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="I'll take one. It's possible." name="GEORGE" /><sd>Mid-episode monologue.</sd><sd>The problem with the condom is still buying them. I think we should have like a</sd><sd>secret signal with the druggist that you just walk into the drugstore, you go up</sd><sd>to the counter, he looks at you and if you go like this (nods) he puts them in</sd><sd>the bag for you, that's it. You show up there, you put your little shaving</sd><sd>cream, your little toothpaste, you know, "How are you today?" (nods) "Have a</sd><sd>nice day." "You too."</sd><sd>Elaine and Jerry are on the phone, waiting for George and Cynthia's date to end.</sd><char dialog="So where are they already, it's a quarter to twelve, they should be back" name="JERRY" /><sd>by now, what did they do?</sd><char dialog="I think they went out to dinner." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Wait, I got another call. That must be him. (clicks over) Hello?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah, it's me, I just got home." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Oh, hold on. (clicks back) It's George, he just got home." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah, yeah, I got Cynthia on the other line." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Alright, I'll call you back as soon as I'm done." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Remember our pact. Full disclosure." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Of course. (clicks back to George) Yeah, go ahead." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Alright look, I'm gonna tell you, but I made a pact with Cynthia, we" name="GEORGE" /><sd>swore we were not going to tell you and Elaine.</sd><char dialog="You can tell me, I'll vault it." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="It's in the vault?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I'm locking the vault. What?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="We had sex." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Oh my god, you had sex, how did that happen?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I don't know. I closed my eyes and made a move." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="At your apartment?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="She didn't stay over?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No, she left. Listen, you can't mention any of this to Elaine." name="GEORGE" /><sd>Cynthia will kill me, we made a deal.</sd><sd>Cut to Elaine on the phone with Cynthia.</sd><char dialog="Oh my god." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="He was uncomfortable because it was our first time so he felt he would" name="CYNTHIA" /><sd>perform better if we did it in the kitchen. He said the kitchen is always the</sd><sd>most sociable room in the house. And he was serious.</sd><char dialog="So? How was it?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="How good could it be? My head was on a hot plate." name="CYNTHIA" /><char dialog="Wait, I got another call, that must be Jerry." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Oh wait, don't you tell him any of this." name="CYNTHIA" /><char dialog="Yeah, ok. (clicks over) Hello?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="So, what did she have to say?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="What did he have to say?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="He said they had a good time." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Her too." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Oh, good." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Anything else?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Nope. You?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Nope." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="You sure?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yup. You?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Yeah." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Alright. Well uh, guess everything is under control." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Yeah. Okay then." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Alright. Goodnight." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Goodnight." name="JERRY" /><sd>Jerry and George are at Jerry's apartment.</sd><char dialog="I left three messages. I can't believe this woman. She has sex with" name="GEORGE" /><sd>me, leaves ten minutes later then I never hear from her again. What kind of a</sd><sd>person does this? I mean, she used me. I feel cheap and violated.</sd><char dialog="Well, I'm gonna do something about this." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="What are you gonna do?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Nevermind. Disgraceful. Leaves you sitting there on the kitchen floor" name="JERRY" /><sd>like some kind of roach trap. Wham, bam, thank you ma'am. Sir, whatever.</sd><sd>She's not going to get away with this.</sd><char dialog="I keep wracking my brain to try and figure out what I did. I was" name="GEORGE" /><sd>smart, I was funny, I made great small talk with the waitress so she could see I</sd><sd>could relate to the commoners, you know, I'm a man of the people.</sd><char dialog="I'm gonna call her." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No, don't call her." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="No, I'm calling her." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No, Jerry, don't call." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="No, forget it, I'm gonna call." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I don't want you to call." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Get away from me, I'm gonna call her." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Give me the phone!" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="George, do you wanna fight? Do you wanna fight?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Jerry, I'm gonna kill you!" name="GEORGE" /><sd>Kramer enters and gets between them to break up the fight.</sd><char dialog="Hey hey hey!! Come on! Jerry, George, now stop it!" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="I'll just call her when you leave!" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="You can't do that, it's none of your business!" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="It is so my business!" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Hey hey hey! I don't want to hear another word out of either one of" name="KRAMER" /><sd>you!</sd><char dialog="But tell him to give me the--" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Ay ay ay! The next one of you that opens up your mouth, says" name="KRAMER" /><sd>something, you're gonna have to deal with me. You know, I bet I know what this</sd><sd>is about. It's about a woman, isn't it?</sd><char dialog="No." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Yeah, but--" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah yeah! You see, this is exactly what they want to do to you. They" name="KRAMER" /><sd>play one against the other. You can't let them manipulate you like that.</sd><char dialog="But Kramer--" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Noh noh noh! I want you guys to shake hands. Come on, there are" name="KRAMER" /><sd>plenty of women out there for all of us, let's go.</sd><sd>Jerry and George shake hands.</sd><char dialog="Yes. You see? Isn't that better than fighting? Animosity? I mean," name="KRAMER" /><sd>you wanna fight with somebody, you fight with me. Oh, by the way George, you</sd><sd>know those condoms I gave you? They're defective, don't use them.</sd><char dialog="What?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Right." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Defective?!" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Defective." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="How could you give me a defective condom?!" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I didn't even know they were defective." name="KRAMER" /><sd>Jerry gets between them to break up the fight.</sd><char dialog="Didn't even thin you were gonna use them." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="What do you mean you didn't think I wasn't gonna use them?!" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Take it easy, you guys, just spread out! Don't worry about it, if" name="JERRY" /><sd>anything was wrong she would have called you already!</sd><sd>Elaine answers her door, it's Cynthia.</sd><char dialog="I missed my period." name="CYNTHIA" /><char dialog="Oh my god." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="I am very worried, I am never late." name="CYNTHIA" /><char dialog="But he used a condom, right?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="I know, but these things aren't always foolproof." name="CYNTHIA" /><char dialog="Oh no." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="What?" name="CYNTHIA" /><char dialog="Was it blue?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Yeah. How'd you know?" name="CYNTHIA" /><char dialog="Just a hunch." name="ELAINE" /><sd>Jerry is in his apartment trying to open a bottle of soda.</sd><char dialog="Ow! Ow! Twist off! Twist off! Twist off!" name="JERRY" /><sd>Elaine walks in and give him a funny look.</sd><char dialog="Oh, hi. Soda?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No thanks." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="So tell me. What's the problem with your little flaky friend? She" name="JERRY" /><sd>doesn't return calls?</sd><char dialog="Who are you to talk about her like that? She'll call him when she's" name="ELAINE" /><sd>good and ready. You don't even know her.</sd><char dialog="Oh, I know her. I know her type." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Her type? What type?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="The type that doesn't return phone calls. I knew we shouldn't have done" name="JERRY" /><sd>this, it was a bad idea in the first place, I told you!</sd><char dialog="You told me? You pushed this whole thing on me, it was your idea!" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="I was just trying to help your bitter, twisted friend." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="She's not bitter!" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Well, bitter's a judgement call, but she's twisted!" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Twisted? God, I did you a favor." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="I thought you said they had a good time, is there anything else you're" name="JERRY" /><sd>keeping from me?</sd><char dialog="Are you calling me a liar?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="I'm calling you one if you are one, are you a liar?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Are you?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Get your finger out of my face." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="You get yours out, I was here first!" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="I don't care." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Get it out!" name="ELAINE" /><sd>Kramer walks in just as this argument begins to turn into a slap fight, and gets</sd><sd>in the middle.</sd><char dialog="Hey hey, alright, hey hey, stop it! Come on, break it up! What's the" name="KRAMER" /><sd>matter with you? Now don't you two see that you're in love with each other? I</sd><sd>mean, why can't you face that already? You're running around out there looking</sd><sd>for something that's not even there, when everything that you dream of is right</sd><sd>here, right here in front of you. Now why can't you admit that? By the way,</sd><sd>when you see George give him these, these'll work.</sd><char dialog="I knew those condoms were defective!" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="How did you know they were defective?!" name="JERRY" /><sd>George walks in.</sd><char dialog="Because! Because she missed her period!" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="She missed her period? Oh my god. I can't believe it! I'm a father!" name="GEORGE" /><sd>I did it! My boys can swim! I can do it! I can do it!</sd><sd>George rushes out, hysterical.</sd><sd>Elaine and Cynthia are at a restaurant.</sd><char dialog="So he shows up. He's all out of breath. He's disheveled. And he" name="CYNTHIA" /><sd>tells me that no matter what happens, whatever I decide is fine with him and</sd><sd>that I could depend on him, and that he would be there to support me in whatever</sd><sd>way I need. Elaine, I was speechless.</sd><char dialog="Wow. Wow. You see? You think you know somebody." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="I said to him, &quot;I really appreciate this, but I just got my period.&quot;" name="CYNTHIA" /><sd>And so, I asked him to come in, he came in--</sd><sd>George and Jerry walk up, Jerry is limping.</sd><char dialog="Hi!" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Sorry, we're a little late.
