That's kind of the job of clothes; to get compliments for us, because it's very hard to get compliments based on your human qualities. Right?

But after replacing the</sd><sd>shaker, she knocks her glass of red wine over her dress.</sd><char dialog="(horrified) Oh my god!" name="CHRISTIE" /><char dialog="Oh." name="JERRY" /><sd>Christie mops at the spill with her napkin, but there's only so much</sd><sd>you can do.</sd><char dialog="Ahh. I can't go to the movies like this. Do you mind if we go" name="CHRISTIE" /><sd>back to my apartment, so I can change?</sd><char dialog="Change?

On the" name="NEWMAN" /><sd>one hand, Elaine, your promise was given in haste. But was it not still a promise? Hmm?</sd><sd>Kramer looks at Elaine, thinking his arguments have put him one up.</sd><char dialog="And, Kramer, you did provide a service in exchange for" name="NEWMAN" /><sd>compensation. But, does the fee, once paid, not entitle the buyer to some assurance</sd><sd>Of reliability? Hmm? Huh? Ahh. These were not easy questions to answer.</sd><sd>Not for any man...</sd><sd>Kramer leans forward to receive the result. Elaine looks as attentive</sd><sd>as she can while only being able to look upwards.</sd><char dialog="...But I have made a decision.

To ruin the bike?!" name="ELAINE" /><sd>Newman's face drops at her negative reaction. Kramer looks across at</sd><sd>the bike, looking worried.</sd><char dialog="Alright, fine. Fine. Go ahead. (standing) Cut the stupid thing" name="ELAINE" /><sd>in half.</sd><char dialog="No, no, no. Give it to her. I'd rather it belonged to another" name="KRAMER" /><sd>than see it destroyed. Newman, give it to her, I beg you.</sd><char dialog="Yeah, yeah, y-yeah." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Not so fast, Elaine!

By all means, change." name="JERRY" /><sd>Christie walks away down a hallway. Jerry removes his coat and sits</sd><sd>down. He looks around himself. On the coffee table he notices a small framed</sd><sd>picture of Christie and some guy. In the picture, she's wearing the same black and</sd><sd>White dress. Jerry picks it up and examines it more closely, reading a date</sd><sd>written on the photo.</sd><char dialog="August seventeen, nineteen-ninety-two. The same dress!" name="JERRY" /><sd>She never</sd><sd>changes! Oh my god. (looking around) She's gotta have hundreds of these</sd><sd>dresses.</sd><sd>Jerry gets up from his seat.</sd><char dialog="There must be a secret stash around here somewhere." name="JERRY" /><sd>Jerry opens a closet and begins to look inside. While he's rooting</sd><sd>about in there, Christie reenters the room, wearing a robe and looking indignant</sd><sd>at discovering Jerry invading her privacy.</sd><char dialog="Ahem! Are you looking for something?" name="CHRISTIE" /><char dialog="What're you doing? I thought you were changing." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No, I, I'm thinking we should just call it a night." name="CHRISTIE" /><char dialog="No, no. C'mon, put something else on. It's early, let's go out." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="If it's all the same to you, I think I'm just gonna go to" name="CHRISTIE" /><sd>bed.</sd><sd>Jerry moves to the couch, where he half lays down.</sd><char dialog="You know, I'm kinda tired myself. Maybe I'll just sleep here on" name="JERRY" /><sd>The couch. Then in the morning, you'll get dressed, we'll walk out</sd><sd>together. Both dressed, different clothes. Well, I'll be in the same clothes. You'll</sd><sd>of course be in different clothes, because it's your apartment. But we'll go</sd><sd>downstairs, me in my same clothes, you in your different clothes.</sd><char dialog="(unequivocal) Jerry.

It doesn't even have to be one on one, you can</sd><sd>bring a group of friends. I just wanna see you. Wait, don't hang up on me.</sd><sd>(hurriedly) Why d'you wear the same dress all the time?
