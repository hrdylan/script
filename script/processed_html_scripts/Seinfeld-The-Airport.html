I timed this out so we would pull up at the terminal *exactly* 17 minutes after their flight is supposed to land. That gives them just enough time to get off the plane, pick up their bags and be walking *out* of the terminal as we roll up." name="GEORGE" /><sd>I tell you, it's a thing of beauty.

Duty Free is the biggest sucker deal in retail." name="GEORGE" /><sd>Do you know how much duty is?</sd><char dialog="Duty." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Yeah, &quot;duty&quot;. Do you know how much duty is?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="No, I dunno how much duty is." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Duty is *nothing*.

Turn to page" name="TIA" /><char dialog="" name="146." /><sd>Oh yeah, did I mention he had a magazine on his lap and *that's* what she was gawking at? Anyway, he checks out page 146.</sd><char dialog="Wow! Coming out of the shower... It's a good thing they gave you" name="JERRY" /><sd>that washcloth to cover yourself up...</sd><sd>Um, what was that page number again?</sd><char dialog="What is this an ad for?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="See those wrinkled jeans slung over the chair? Way in the background, out of focus?" name="TIA" /><char dialog="Uh-huh..." name="JERRY" /><sd>In traffic, Kramer and George are surrounded by honking cars and what is obviously heavy traffic...</sd><char dialog="How does it look on your side? (Pause while George just stares at him) We'll get there..." name="KRAMER" /><sd>Back in, ugh, *coach* (those heathens), the annoying guy is sleeping beside</sd><char dialog="Oh, look at this... He's sleeping and I have to go to the bathroom. Maybe he'll wake up soon. What if my kidneys burst? Is it worth it not to wake this man up to damage a major organ? I hope this disgusting slob appreciates what I'm doing for him... (To passenger on the other side of her, but still to herself) Yeah, make a little more noise with your gum-- that's helpful." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="They're not here! You cost me fifty bucks!" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Look at you! You run like a girl! Run like a man! Lift your knees!" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Look, we're wasting our time here! We're a half-hour late, they've probably took it off the board already." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="No, there it is, right there-- 133... and it's canceled." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Canceled? Do I still get credit for the pick up? I was here!" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Ok, c'mon... let's go check over at the ticket counter." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Oh, there it is honey, gate 18A, 8:30... (He leaves)" name="GROSSBARD" /><char dialog="Did you see that guy?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="No... What guy?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="That guy.. He was just..." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Listen, you go over to the ticket counter, I'm going to go stop in the gift shop and pick up a copy of Time magazine. There's supposed to ba blurb about Jerry in it and I think he mentioned my name!" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="(still lost) I know that guy..." name="KRAMER" /><sd>Y'know, he looks familiar to me, too. Reminds me of this guy John Grossbard that I knew a while back. Got me involved in one of those shady pyramid schemes... Man, if I ever meet up with him again...</sd><char dialog="Gotta get my Time magazine... Never miss my Time magazine." name="PRISONER" /><char dialog="Yeah, get your magazine and let's get out of here." name="GUARD" /><sd>George lifts the last copy from the rack before the con can get it.</sd><char dialog="Hey, I was gonna take that!" name="PRISONER" /><char dialog="Gee, I'm sorry... I got here first." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I don't care when you got here, I want the magazine..." name="PRISONER" /><char dialog="You don't understand, there's a *blurb* about me in this magazine!" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="A *blurb*?!? *You're* a blurb! Check out the cover, idiot!" name="PRISONER" /><char dialog="All right, let's go..." name="GUARD" /><sd>George checks out the cover shot which shows a picture of the aforementioned prisoner with the caption "Caught!" written below.</sd><char dialog="I want the magazine!" name="PRISONER" /><char dialog="Umm... No." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="You know what I would do to you, if I wasn't in these shackles..." name="PRISONER" /><char dialog="But you are Blanche... You *are* in the shackles. Oh, I can't wait to read my *Time* magazine! Laaaast copy, too. Maybe I'll read it tomorrow-- in the park! It's supposed to be a beeyootiful day! Have a nice life... sentence, that is!" name="GEORGE" /><sd>Kramer comes into the gift shop and does a Krameresque double-take at "that guy" from the departure screen who's browsing books. He goes up to</sd><sd>George.</sd><char dialog="They're on a different flight. They're scheduled to land in a half hour, only at Laguardia." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Laguardia? All right, let's go. C'mon..." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Where do I know that guy from?" name="KRAMER" /><sd>Back in the developing nation section of the plane (coach, that is), Elaine is still pining for the guy next to her to wake up so she can go to the bathroom.</sd><char dialog="(To herself, loudly) Wake up, you human slug! Wake up! *Wake*" name="ELAINE" /><sd>*up*!! I can't hold it anymore! (To the slug out loud) Excuse me, I've gotta go to the bathroom...</sd><sd>The cad has the nerve to look peeved, and Elaine has a hard time getting out of her seat. She looks a little like Kramer stumbling and falling into the aisle. The capper is that as she's getting up, facing the row of seats (and their staring sitters) across from her, Elaine makes faces at them like she's a homicidal maniac from "Taxi Driver". You can just see the words "You lookin' at *me*?" etched in her brain. It's a killer.</sd><sd>Anyway, as Elaine scurries off to the bathroom, Jerry and Tia are enjoying some hot towels on their faces.</sd><char dialog="Oh my... that *is* refreshing..." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Would you care for some slippers?" name="ATTENDANT" /><char dialog="Sounds lovely! (To Tia, motioning to put them on her) May I?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Please!" name="TIA" /><char dialog="Why, It's a perfect fit. You must be Cinderella." name="JERRY" /><sd>They chortle to themselves and tink glasses (no, that's not a cleverly- masked euphemism). Back in the car...</sd><char dialog="My name is not mentioned in this blurb..." name="GEORGE" /><sd>Ding!</sd><char dialog="It's Grossbard!" name="KRAMER" /><sd>Why don't these people listen to me? I don't understand...</sd><char dialog="Who's Grossbard?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="When I lived on Third avenue and 18th street 20 years ago, I had this roommate who was *always* behind in his rent. Then one month," name="KRAMER" /><sd>he asks me to loan him his share of the rent-- 240 bucks! He took the cash and )pfffft( disappears. Well, I try to find him, I went</sd><sd>to his girlfriend's house, even his family. Uh-uh. I never got the money back! He screwed me! And that's the guy-- John Grossbard!</sd><char dialog="Hey Kramer, c'mon-- it was 240 bucks twenty years ago..." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="No, I'm gonna turn around... I'm gonna get that guy..." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="No-no-no, Kramer. Kramer! Kramer! You *cannot* abandon people in the middle of an airport pickup! It's a binding social contract." name="GEORGE" /><sd>We... we must go forward... not back.</sd><sd>George, that's beautiful. Ever thought of running for office?</sd><char dialog="Tia, did you see all the flowers in that bathroom? It's like an English garden in there." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="They're gardenias, mostly." name="ATTENDANT" /><char dialog="I thought I smelled lilac." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yes, there are a few of those, too..." name="ATTENDANT" /><char dialog="It's almost overwhelming..." name="TIA" /><char dialog="Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. Due to equipment problems at the runway at Laguardia, we've been" name="CAPTAIN" /><sd>instructed by the tower to re-route and land at JFK. We apologize for any inconvenience...</sd><char dialog="(To anyone who'll listen) What'd he say? What'd he say?" name="ELAINE" /><sd>Back to George and Kramer at Laguardia; George has been inside to see if J+E are there, he reports his findings back to Kramer in the car.</sd><char dialog="Well, You're not gonna believe it..." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="What?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="The plane's been re-routed *back* to Kennedy. We've got 45 minutes." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Let's go. Listen to the bell, Grossbard-- it tolls for thee." name="KRAMER" /><sd>Kramer peels out. He's on a mission from God.</sd><char dialog="We have some *delicious* Chateau Briande, my personal favourite." name="ATTENDANT" /><sd>Or, if you prefer something lighter, a poached Dover sole in a delicate white wine sauce with just a *hint* of saffron.</sd><char dialog="Oh, saffron! That sounds good." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="And today we're featuring wines from the *Tuscany* region..." name="ATTENDANT" /><char dialog="Tuscany!" name="JERRY+TIA" /><sd>They do that "tink" thing again, and we rejoin Elaine going back to her seat, but the other attendant is serving the slop to the unwashed masses</sd><sd>in coach and he's in her way.</sd><char dialog="Hi. Can I get to my seat?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="You're just gonna have to wait..." name="ATTENDANT" /><char dialog="But you just passed it. I'm sitting right there next to that guy..." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="You're not supposed to get up during the food service." name="ATTENDANT" /><char dialog="Well, nobody *told* me that!" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Look. This plane is *full*. I got a lot of people to serve." name="ATTENDANT" /><sd>Now please... You're just gonna have to wait.</sd><sd>Back at JFK, George and Kramer check out the Arrivals board (again)...</sd><char dialog="There it is. Gate 46... We got plenty of time." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Grossbard's plane leaves in ten minutes. I *still* got time to" name="KRAMER" /><sd>catch him!</sd><char dialog="How you gonna catch him? He's probably boarded the plane already." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Gimme your credit card." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="My credit card?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Just gimme the card, don't ask me any questions." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="I'm not gonna give you my card unless you tell me what it's for!" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I'm gonna buy a ticket-- I'm gonna get on that flight." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="What, are you, nuts? You're gonna spend more on the ticket than you're gonna get back from Grossbard." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="No, I'm not gonna use the ticket! I'm gonna get my money, I'll get" name="KRAMER" /><sd>off the plane and turn your ticket in for a refund. It's not gonna cost you a dime! Now gimme the card.</sd><char dialog="This is a *great* idea! Here... use this one. I get frequent flyer" name="GEORGE" /><sd>miles with every purchase... Wait! Get two tickets. As long as</sd><sd>your turning it in for a refund what's the difference? I'll get *double* the bonus miles.</sd><sd>Back in *coach* (I get hives just thinking about it), Elaine returns to her</sd><sd>seat now that the attendant is done serving.</sd><char dialog="Excuse me. I'm sorry to make you do this, but I got stuck in the aisle and the flight attendant wouldn't let me get through." name="ELAINE" /><sd>There's no way to get around that cart...</sd><char dialog="You're not supposed to get up during the food service." name="PASSENGER 1" /><char dialog="I'll try and remember that. (Pause) Where's my meal?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="He asked me where you were, and you were gone so long I thought you, uh, switched seats." name="PASSENGER 1" /><sd>Uh-huh... Elaine addresses the nearby attendant.</sd><char dialog="Excuse me? Excuse me, but I didn't get a meal." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Are you sure?" name="ATTENDANT" /><char dialog="Yes, I'm sure! I would know if a tray of food had been served to me." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Would you?" name="ATTENDANT" /><sd>Ooooh, them's fightin' words, Monroe.</sd><char dialog="Well, the only meal left is a kosher meal." name="ATTENDANT" /><char dialog="Kosher meal? I don't want a kosher meal. I don't even know what a kosher meal is." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="I think it means when a Rabbi has inspected it, or something." name="PASSENGER 1" /><char dialog="No, no. It all has to do with the way they kill the pig." name="PASSENGER 2" /><char dialog="They don't eat pigs!" name="PASSENGER 1" /><char dialog="They do if it's killed right-- under a Rabbi's supervision." name="PASSENGER 2" /><sd>Ummmm, sure. Another (uncredited) passenger addresses the debate from somewhere out of camera range.</sd><char dialog="Oh, You know what? *I* ordered the kosher meal." name="PASSENGER 3" /><char dialog="Then why didn't you take it?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="I ordered it six weeks ago, I forgot." name="PASSENGER 3" /><char dialog="You're eating my food!" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Look, I got earplugs to collect. Do you want it, or not." name="ATTENDANT" /><sd>Take the food, Elaine. But ask that guy just what the heck a kosher meal is-- I'm curious...</sd><sd>Meanwhile, Jerry and Tia enjoy a nummy-lookin' dessert treat.</sd><char dialog="Mmmmmmmm!" name="J+T" /><char dialog="This is the best sundae I've ever had." name="TIA" /><char dialog="Oh, man. You know what... they got the fudge on the bottom-- y'see?" name="JERRY" /><sd>That enables you to control your fudge distribution as you're eatin' your ice cream.</sd><char dialog="I've never met a man who knew so much about nothing." name="TIA" /><char dialog="Thank you..." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Mmmmmm!" name="J+T" /><sd>We get a quick shot of Elaine staring at *something* on the end of her fork</sd><char dialog="More anything?" name="ATTENDANT" /><char dialog="More everything!" name="JERRY" /><sd>Does that include Rabbi-slaughtered bovines?</sd><sd>Back at JFK...</sd><char dialog="Look, I got Super Savers! C'mon." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Super Savers? Are they refundable!?" name="GEORGE" /><sd>No.</sd><char dialog="You bought non-refundable tickets, you idiot!" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="She talked me in to it-- she said it was the best deal." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Do you know how much this is going to cost me?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Look, I'll tell you what-- I'll split it with you" name="KRAMER" /><sd>How big of you, you brute. They board the plane.</sd><char dialog="Look, I'm gonna go to the bathroom..." name="GEORGE" /><sd>I dunno, George. Those *coach* bathrooms stink. Just ask Elaine.</sd><sd>Kramer goes forward and confronts Grossbard. For his part, Grossbard doesn't seem to recognise Kramer from twenty years ago (then again, he apparently had short hair at the time). After trying in vain to reach Grossbard's wallet, Kramer is escorted off the plane. Before this can take place, George knocks on the bathroom door to a reply of "Just a minute" from the occupant inside (I bet he stinks). Anyway, the door opens and, surprise! It's the Prisoner without his Time magazine (at least now we know why he needed it so badly-- reading material for the john). Anyway, the guy pulls George into the bathroom (he's still wearing his cuffs and shackles, BTW (that's got to make it rather difficult to go to the bathroom, but I digress)). So, while George is in the can with the serial killer, Kramer is escorted off the plane. Don't worry-- the plane isn't moving yet. And what's up with going to the bathroom on a non-moving plane? Isn't there laws against that? Or is it just trains that you have to wait until they're moving? Who really cares, anyway?</sd><char dialog="Excuse me... Excuuuse me..." name="ATTENDANT" /><char dialog="What? Oh, no... nothing for me thanks." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="What is your name?" name="ATTENDANT" /><char dialog="Elaine Benes?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="(Checks her list) You're going to have to go back to coach." name="ATTENDANT" /><char dialog="No, but there was nobody sitting here..." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Yes, but you're still not allowed. These seats are very expensive." name="ATTENDANT" /><char dialog="Oh, no, please, don't send me back there. Please, I'll do anything. It's so nice up here. It's so comfortable up here. I don't want to go back there. Please don't send me back there... (She notices another attendant offering goods)" name="ELAINE" /><sd>Oh, you got *cookies*!</sd><char dialog="You're going to have to go back to your seat!" name="ATTENDANT" /><char dialog="Ok, fine. I'll go back... You know, our goal should be a society *without* *classes*! (She goes through the curtain to,ick, *coach*) Do you realise that the people up here are getting *cookies*!" name="ELAINE" /><sd>The outburst has awoken Jerry and Tia who are sharing a blanket and napping (at least, that's what I *think* they're doing under that big, blue blanket...)</sd><char dialog="What is all the racket back there? You know, you're trying to relax on the plane and this is what you have to put up with." name="JERRY" /><sd>(To attendant) What is going on?</sd><char dialog="Sir, this woman tried to *sneak* into first class." name="ATTENDANT" /><char dialog="Oh, you see, that's terrible. The problem is, that curtain is no security-- there really should be a locking door." name="JERRY" /><sd>Electrified, with a moat if possible. They return to snuggling...</sd><char dialog="Hey! That guy owes me 240 bucks!" name="KRAMER" /><sd>No good. He breaks free and makes a run for it and seemingly escapes.</sd><sd>Meanwhile, Jerry is getting ready for deboarding and he glances out the window only to see a rather harried Kramer running, arms flailing out on the runway.
