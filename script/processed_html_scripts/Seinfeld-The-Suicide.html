<root><char dialog="Written by Tom Leopold" name="THE SUICIDE" /><set>(Comedy club)</set><sd>The thing I don't understand about the suicide person is the people who try and commit suicide for some reason they don't die and that's it. They stop trying. Why? Why don't they just keep trying? What has changed? Is their life any better now? No. In fact it's worse because now they've found out one more thing you stink at. Okay, that's why these people don't succeed in life to begin with. Because they give up too easy. I say, pills don't work, try a rope. Car won't start in the garage, get a tune up. You know what I mean? There's nothing more rewarding than reaching a goal you have set for yourself.</sd><set>(Jerry's Apartment)</set><char dialog="Let me ask you a question.
