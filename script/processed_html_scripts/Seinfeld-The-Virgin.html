We got all day tomorrow to come up with a story." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="All day tomorrow? We had a month and a half to come up with something and we didn't do anything." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="So we'll do it tomorrow." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Let me ask you something. When's the last time you went skiing?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="About six years ago." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I think you can take the lift ticket off your jacket now." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Women like skiers." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="So what? You can't meet anybody. You're going on with Susan." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah. Right." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Hey, see those two women over there? I almost dated the one on the right. She's in the closet business." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="The closet business? What's the closet business?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="What is it your business?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I'm interested." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="She reorganizes your closet and shows you how to maximize your closet space. She looked into my closet." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="So you thought she was good looking and figured this would be a good way to meet her." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Yeah." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah. So what happened?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="So, she mentioned she had a boyfriend and then it hit me. What do I need more closet space for? (Across the room) Hi, Marla." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="(Walks over to Jerry and George) Jerry." name="MARLA" /><char dialog="George, Marla." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Marla." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="George. Jerry, Stacey." name="MARLA" /><char dialog="Stacey." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Jerry." name="STACEY" /><char dialog="George, Stacey." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Stacey." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="George." name="STACEY" /><char dialog="George." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Jerry. Marla. (Realizing Jerry's cue) Stacey! (Walks over to Stacey)" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="So, how was your trip to Berlin?" name="MARLA" /><char dialog="Trip to Berlin?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Remember? That's why you put off doing the closets. You said you were going to Berlin for a while." name="MARLA" /><char dialog="Oh, right, right." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="The wall had just come down, and you told me you wanted to be part of the celebration." name="MARLA" /><char dialog="Yes, yes, I did. But, you know, I was watching it on CNN, and they covered it so well I thought, &quot;Why knock my brains out?&quot;" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="You, know my boyfriend went." name="MARLA" /><char dialog="Really?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yes, I told him all about you going and he got all excited and decided to go." name="MARLA" /><char dialog="Oh, did he like it?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I don't know. He never came back. (Over to the other side of the bar)" name="MARLA" /><char dialog="Anyway, we met with NBC about a month ago and they gave us the green light to go ahead and write a pilot. In fact, we got a big meeting with them tomorrow. They gotta approve of the story before we can write." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Wow, what a great job. A writer." name="STACEY" /><char dialog="Not a bad way to make a buck." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Sounds great." name="STACEY" /><char dialog="Well, I'll tell you, Stacey. It's a lot of hard work. But, it comes fairly easy to me. Some people write symphonies. This is my gift. (Raises ski lift ticket while Stacey looks away)" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="So, are you gonna go out with her?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I might." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="What about Susan?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="What? I'm not married. I'm not allowed to go out with somebody else?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Depends." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Depends on what?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="On many factors." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Like what?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Well, how long you've been seeing her. What's your phone call frequency? Are you on a daily?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No. Semi-daily. Four or five times a week." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="What about Saturday nights? Do you have to ask her out, or is a date implied?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Implied." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="She got anything in your medicine cabinet?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="There might be some moisturizer." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Ah hah. Let me ask you this. Is there any tampax in your house?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="(Pause) Yeah." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Well, I'll tell you what you've got here." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="What?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="You got yourself a girlfriend." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Ah, no, no. Are you sure? A girlfriend?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I'm looking at a guy in a semi-daily with tampax in his house and an implied date on Saturday night. I would like to help you out, but..." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Would you believe my luck? The first time in my life I have a good answer to the question, &quot;What do you do?&quot; and I have a girlfriend. I mean, you don't need a girlfriend when you can answer that question. That's what you say in order to get girlfriends. Once you can get a girlfriend, you don't want a girlfriend, you just want more girlfriends." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="You're going to make a good father someday." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Well it's not fair, Jerry. It's just not fair. All right, all right. That's it. I'm getting out of this thing." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Fine. Break up with her. But you know what this means?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No, what?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="The script, the pilot, the TV show. That's all over." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Why? What do you mean?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Figure it out. She's one of the executives at NBC that's gonna make the decision whether or not they pick up the show. She's one of our biggest fans. You drop her off, you think they're gonna pick us up?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Oh, right. Oh no, man." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="you know, it's a very interesting situation. Here you have a job that can get you girls. But, you also have a relationship. But if you try and get rid of the relationship so you can get the girls, you lose the job. You see the irony?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah, yeah. I see the irony. All right. What about this? What if I can find some way to break up with her so that she'll still like me and it doesn't affect the deal." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="(sarcastically) Oh, yeah." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Wait, wait. Here me out. Don't dismiss this. You're very quick to dismiss. Don't dismiss. She's got a big crush on David Letterman, I mean, a big crush. She talks about him all the time. Suppose I go up to David Letterman. He works at NBC; I work at NBC. I explain my situation. He agrees to meet her. They go out, they fall madly in love. And she dumps me for David Letterman." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="This is your plan?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No, no. I'm just thinking." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I don't think you are." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Let me tell you what I think." name="MARLA" /><char dialog="Please, and be brutal. I have no closet sensitivity." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Are you very fussy about your pants?" name="MARLA" /><char dialog="I don't think I am." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Because I have a very radical idea. Can you handle it?" name="MARLA" /><char dialog="Try me." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Here's what I'm proposing. We eliminate all this. The hangers, the bar, the shelves. And in its place install a series of hooks. We'll put everything on hooks." name="MARLA" /><char dialog="Everything?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Everything. The shirts, pants, sport jackets, pajamas. We could get eighty hooks on here." name="MARLA" /><char dialog="You're quite mad, you know. (Kramer enters) Oh, I don't believe this. (Goes into other room) Hey?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Hey." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="What are you doing?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I'm watching The Bold and the Beautiful." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="No." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="What?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="This is not a good time." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Five minutes. What?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="What did you have to give your TV away to George for?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Because I've been watching too much. It was an addiction. I couldn't stop. It was, it was destroying my brain cells." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Yeah, but now you're in here all the time. (Marla enters from other room)" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Well, wow." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Marla, Kramer." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Hey." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Why don't you go out? It's nice out." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Oh, no. There's nothing out there for me." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="There's weather." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Weather? I don't need weather. Weather doesn't do it for me." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="I'm tellin' George to give you your TV back." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No, no, I don't want it back. (Pause) Are you gonna watch the Knick game tonight?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="I don't know." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Will you tape it?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Kramer... (points to Marla)" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah. (He exits)" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="So your boyfriend never came back from Berlin." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Never came back." name="MARLA" /><char dialog="Oh, you must have been devastated being left for a wall." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="It was about to end anyway. There was this... problem." name="MARLA" /><char dialog="Ah hah. (Buzzer) Excuse me one second. Yeah?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="It's me." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Come on up. Oh, it's Elaine, she's just a friend of mine. I don't know what she's doing here now. (Buzzer) I'm sorry. What?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I didn't get it." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Ugh. So you were saying there was this problem." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Well, he wanted me to move in with him." name="MARLA" /><char dialog="Snapple?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No thanks." name="MARLA" /><char dialog="Go on." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Well I wouldn't move in because..." name="MARLA" /><char dialog="Yes." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Well because..." name="MARLA" /><char dialog="Yeah." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Well because I'm a virgin. (Elaine enters)" name="MARLA" /><char dialog="Hello!" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Hi, um. Marla, Elaine." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I'm sorry, I didn't know you had company. I just wanted to return your tape." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Oh, thanks a lot, two weeks late. Now that costs me thirty-five dollars to see Havana." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I'm sorry, I really am. I just kept forgetting." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="I should be going." name="MARLA" /><char dialog="No, no, I'm leaving." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="I like that thing in your hair there." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Oh yeah? This woman was selling them at this crazy party I was at last night. You'll appreciate this. Snapple?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="No thanks." name="MARLA" /><char dialog="I was talking to this guy, you know, and I just happened to throw my purse on the sofa. And my diaphragm goes flying out. So I just froze, you know, ahh! Staring at my diaphragm. You know, it's just lying there. So then, this woman, the one who sold me this hair thing, she grabbed it before the guy noticed, so. I mean, big deal, right? So I carry around my diaphragm, who doesn't? Yeah, like it's a big, big secret that women carry around their diaphragms. You never know when you're gonna need it, right? (Sips the Snapple) Ahh." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="I should be going." name="MARLA" /><char dialog="So we'll talk about the hooks then?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yes. (She exits)" name="MARLA" /><char dialog="What? Was it something I said?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="She's a virgin, she just told me." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Well I didn't know." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Well it's not like spotting a toupee." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Well you think I should say something? Should I say something? Should I apologize? Was I being anti-virgin?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="No, no, I mean..." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="'Cause I'm not anti-virgin. I'll be right back. (She leaves)" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Elaine, Elaine... (Buzzer) Yeah?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="It's George." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="She's a virgin?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="A virgin." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Wow. So what're you gonna do?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I don't know. I'm very attracted to her. That accent, it's so sexy." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I don't think I could do it. You know, they always remember the first time. I don't want to be remembered. I wanna be forgotten." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="You need a little pioneer spirit. You know, you don't have any of that Lewis and Clark in you." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="You know, sometimes those guys don't make it back. (Looks in fridge) I'm really hungry." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Yeah, me too." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="We gotta get something. I don't want to go to that meeting on an empty stomach. Let's get some Chinese. You wanna order it?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="All right, but then we gotta get some work done. Let me just call Kramer, see if want anything. (Calls) Hey, we ordering Chinese food. If you want anything-- (Kramer enters quickly) let me know what it is and I'll order for you." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I'm in. Let's go for it." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="What do you want?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I don't care, whatever." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="I'll tell you what. Why don't we just get a couple of dishes and we'll just share 'em." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Okay. What are you getting?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="I'm gonna get a Chow Fung." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="What's a Chow Fung?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="It's a broad noodle." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="What do you mean, a broad noodle?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="It's a big flat noodle." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Well I don't want a big flat noodle." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="What kind of noodle do you want?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Who says I want a noodle?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="All right, look. I'm getting the Chow Fung. You don't have to have any." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="All right. I'll get pea pods and you can't have any of my pea pods." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Fine." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Get extra MSG." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Look, Marla. This whole sex thing is totally overrated. Now, here's the one thing you've gotta be ready for is how the man changes into a completely different person five seconds after it's over. I mean, something happens to their personality it's really quite astounding. It's like they committed a crime and they want to flee the scene before the police get there." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="So they just leave?" name="MARLA" /><char dialog="Yeah, pretty much, yeah. Well, the smart ones start working on their getaway stories during dinner. How, you know, they gotta get up early tomorrow. What is about being up early? They all turn into farmers suddenly." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Wow. It must be pretty good to put up with all that." name="MARLA" /><char dialog="Eh." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="All right, let's go. We don't have much time before the meeting." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Where's the food? What happened to Ping?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Don't worry, he'll be here. Look, we only got about two hours. We just need to come up with one good story so we can get through this meeting. (Buzzer) There's your food." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Hey, what about this? I'm in a car accident. The motorist is uninsured, you with me?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Yeah." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="My car's totaled. It's all his fault and now, he has absolutely no money. There is no way that he can pay me. So the judge decrees that he becomes my butler." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Your butler?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Right. He cooks my food, he cleans my house, he does all my shopping for me. And there you go, that's your program." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="What about me?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Don't worry, we'll find something for you. (Knock of Jerry's door)" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="(Getting the door) That's the stupidest idea I ever heard. Sentenced to be a butler. (Elaine, Marla, and an injured Ping are at the door) Ping, what happened?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="There was a bit of an accident." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Head hurts. Head really hurts." name="PING" /><char dialog="What happened?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Marla and I went out for coffee and afterwards I was crossing the street and he was biking right towards me. So I got out of the way just in time, but then he ran into a parked car. He hit his head and everything went flying." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Something happened to the food?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I only saved one bag." name="PING" /><char dialog="Should I call an ambulance? Do you wanna see a doctor?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I'll get some ice." name="MARLA" /><char dialog="(After looking in the bag) The pea pods? All you saved was the pea pods? (Kramer enters)" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Hey, you got the food?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Yeah, here." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="What took you so long? Hey, Ping!" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Kramer. (Kramer and George sit on the couch)" name="PING" /><char dialog="Yeah. Where's yours?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="He dropped it." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Oh, that's too bad." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="You should slow down, you know that? It's dangerous to go that fast." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="No, no. I have green light. You jaywalked." name="PING" /><char dialog="(To Jerry) Hey, you watchin' Oprah?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="(To Ping) I did not jaywalk." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="(To George) You're givin' him back that" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="" name="TV." /><char dialog="(To Elaine) Yes, you jaywalked." name="PING" /><char dialog="(To Jerry) No, I don't want it back." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="(To Elaine) Jaywalker. I could slap suit on you." name="PING" /><char dialog="(To Jerry) We got work to do. What about the meeting?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="(To himself) Hey, look. An hour with Patrick Swayze." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="A month and a half we had. We did nothing. I can't believe we put it off until today and then we couldn't do anything because Elaine runs out to apologize to a virgin, crosses against a light, and knocks over a Chinese delivery boy. Now we're gonna make fools of ourselves, we got nothing. You're not even in show business. I gotta reputation. You drag me into the sewer with you. I've been on TV buddy boy. You know how fast word spreads in show business? It's like that (Snaps in George's face) , like that! One bad impression, you're outta the business!" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="All right, let's postpone it. Let's get out of here." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="What do you mean? They know we're here." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I'll fake an illness. (Acts it out) My back! My back! I can't believe, my back." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="No, no, would you get up?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I can do this, Jerry." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="No." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="All right, I'll tell them my sister died. (Starts fake crying) My poor sister died. She was standing and then she was laughing and then they SHOT her! That's the kind of sick city that we're livin' in. They shoot you for laughing. I must go and comfort my poor family. Jerry, take me home so I can comfort my... my poor family." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="What?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="That's David Letterman. I just saw David Letterman walk by. I'll be right back. (He exits)" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Mr. Seinfeld, they're ready for you. (She exits)" name="WOMAN" /><char dialog="Yes, I was very wise to hitch my wagon to his star. (Jerry enters meeting)" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Hey, Jerry." name="MAN #1" /><char dialog="Hi, how are you doing? Nice to see you all here. Hello." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Hello, Jerry. I'm Rita Kearson." name="RITA" /><char dialog="Oh, uh, nice to meet you. Where's Russell?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="He, uh, had to go to LA. There's a problem on the set of Blossom." name="RITA" /><char dialog="Oh, poor Blossom. (He sits)" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Anyway, he asked me to sit in for him." name="RITA" /><char dialog="Where's George?" name="MAN #2" /><char dialog="Oh, he ran to say something to David Letterman." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="David Letterman's on the floor?" name="SUSAN" /><char dialog="Yeah, he just walked by." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Well, I think we should get started anyway." name="RITA" /><char dialog="Yeah, good idea." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="So how are you guys comin' along?" name="RITA" /><char dialog="Good, good, we've got a lot of ideas." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Good. (Pause)" name="RITA" /><char dialog="Have you ever been to a Chinese restaurant and they tell you it'll be, like, five minutes for a table and you wind up waitin' there for, like, thirty minutes? Well, we thought it would be very funny to do an entire show where all you're doin' is waitin' for the table. (They don't seem to like it) Because we've all been in that situation. You know, you're waiting... and you're hungry... and you bump into somebody you know... When is Russell coming back?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="So that's the idea?" name="RITA" /><char dialog="Well no, that's one. We have many others. We have an idea where, uh, I get into an accident with a guy who has no insurance and the judge sentences him to be my butler. (Everyone laughs) You know he cooks for me, he has to cook for me... He cleans my house, he's doin' my shopping, you know? I'm walkin' around with one of those big neck collars." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Those collars are funny!" name="MAN #2" /><char dialog="Once you see someone in those collars you start laughing immediately. (George enters)" name="MAN #1" /><char dialog="You tellin' 'em about the butler story? Is that beautiful or what? Hey, sorry I'm late. (Looks at Rita) Russell?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I'm Rita Kearson." name="RITA" /><char dialog="Oh, Rita. Hey, Mr. Shermack, how're you doing, good to see you. Jay, always a pleasure. (To Susan) Sweetie. (Kisses her and then sits down next to Jerry) Yeah, yeah, that butler idea, that's beautiful. Isn't that killer? (Aside to Jerry) I thought I was getting the butler." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Don't worry, uh, we'll find something for you." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="So Letterman didn't spark to your idea, huh?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No, he said there was nothing he could do, and next time I should probably break the Prozacs in half." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="You, you guys wanna hold it down? I'm watchin' Jeopardy." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Would you give him the TV back?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Oh, by the way, George. Susan called for you a minute ago." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="I bet they're probably doing summersaults about us over there. You think they get butler stories like that everyday? (He calls Susan)" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="(To the TV) Who is Joseph Cotton? Giddee up!" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Hello?" name="SUSAN" /><char dialog="Hi, it's me. It's Georgie Boy. What's going on?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="What's going on? What's going on? I'll tell you what's going on. I'm fired!" name="SUSAN" /><char dialog="Fired? Why?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Because you kissed me. You kissed me, you stupid idiot! Rita called Russell and he fired me over the phone." name="SUSAN" /><char dialog="(To the TV) What is pi? Ooh! Giddee up again." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="But I had no... I didn't realize." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="You didn't realize? How could you not realize? You're stupid! You're a stupid, stupid man!" name="SUSAN" /><char dialog="I just feel terrible This is just terrible." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="(To the TV once again) What is the cha-cha? Ooh, yes indeed." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="I'll speak to you later." name="SUSAN" /><char dialog="(Hangs up phone and pauses) this is great! He fired her! This is incredible, he fired her. I'm out, baby! I'm out!" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Why did he fire her?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Because I kissed her in the meeting. Russell found out, he fired her over the phone. Finally, my stupidity pays off!" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="What is here comes the judge, here comes the judge!" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="You can't break up with her now. Her life is shattered. You got her fired. You gotta be there for her." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="What?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="You gotta at least wait until she gets another job." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Another job?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Couple of interviews." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Oh, this is unbelievable. I'm stuck. Every time I think I'm out, they pull me back in." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Are you gonna leave after its over? You know, if we have sex." name="MARLA" /><char dialog="What? Leave? Where? Why?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="You know, the apartment." name="MARLA" /><char dialog="Why would I leave? This is my apartment." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Well what if it was my apartment?" name="MARLA" /><char dialog="Who gave you this idea I would wanna leave?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Well Elaine said men like to leave after it's over." name="MARLA" /><char dialog="Listen, I wouldn't put too much stock into what Elaine has to say about relationships. She comes from a broken home, and I mean that literally. A tree fell on her roof and cracked the whole structure. Her parents got along beautifully, but her house was in bad shape." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Maybe I should get going." name="MARLA" /><char dialog="What else did you say to her?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Nothin'. I was just givin' her the straight dope." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="More like a dope was giving it to her straight. Another cup of coffee with you, she'll wind up in a convent." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Listen, there was a lot more I could've told her, believe me." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="What is that about leaving after sex? Did I ever leave with you?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="You might've if I'd stayed. So you know what? I got served with papers today. Ping is suing me. I need your virgin as a witness. You better be nice to her." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="I was trying to be." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Look at George. (On the other side of the restaurant) He lucked out, huh?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Oh, you're not kiddin'. Who'd 've figured Susan would break up with him? They had a good thing going." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah, since she met him she's been vomited on, her family cabin's been burned down, she learned her father's a homosexual, and she got fired from a high paying network job.
