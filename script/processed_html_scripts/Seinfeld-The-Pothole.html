Annoying little product. 'I" name="JERRY" /><sd>can do this. I can do that.' Why doesn't this stuff just shut up?</sd><char dialog="I'm gonna grab you a towel." name="JENNA" /><sd>Jenna leaves the bathroom. Jerry brushes his teeth. He clearly doesn't like the</sd><sd>taste of the baking soda, and leans over the sink to spit. He puts his hand on</sd><sd>the counter and knocks Jenna's toothbrush off the edge. The brush falls into the</sd><sd>toilet bowl.</sd><sd>There is a shot from beneath the water in the toilet, looking up. Jerry's face</sd><sd>looking down into the bowl, with an expression of shock and horror.</sd><sd>Jerry looks behind him, to see if Jenna has spotted him. He rolls up the sleeve</sd><sd>of his dressing gown, grimaces, and plunges his hand into the toilet. He grabs</sd><sd>the brush out, drops it on a shelf beside the mirror and immediately begins</sd><sd>frantically washing his hands. As he completes this task, he raises his head and</sd><sd>finds Jenna has returned. She is standing behind him, smiling as she brushes her</sd><sd>teeth with the brush he just retrieved from the toilet.</sd><char dialog="Ooh-ooh" name="JERRY" /><set>(Monk's)</set><sd>Jerry and George in a booth, as per usual.</sd><char dialog="So?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="So?

Fastidious?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I'll take fastidious." name="JERRY" /><sd>George puts his keys on the table.

(to Jerry) Such a sweet kid." name="KRAMER" /><set>(Street)</set><sd>Elaine stands on the sidewalk, waiting for someone. She looks up the street and</sd><sd>sees a Chinese delivery boy approaching with a bag of food. She ducks into the</sd><sd>entranceway to the apartment building behind her, and then effects to be coming</sd><sd>out of the building as the delivery boy gets there.</sd><char dialog="Oh. Oh, hi. China Panda?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="(suspicious) Why you waiting on the street and not in your" name="DELIVERY BOY" /><sd>apartment?</sd><char dialog="I... thought that I would meet you halfway." name="ELAINE" /><sd>She takes the bag of food.</sd><char dialog="You really live here?" name="DELIVERY BOY" /><char dialog="Oh yeah. (handing over money) There you go, keep the change. Bye now." name="ELAINE" /><sd>I'll see you.</sd><sd>Elaine walks back towards the door to the building. She expects the boy to</sd><sd>leave, but he's still suspicious, and waits. Elaine tries the door, but it's</sd><sd>locked. She looks, and the boy still waits. Elaine tries the door harder, but it</sd><sd>won't yield. She admits defeat and hands the food back, and receives her money.</sd><sd>The delivery boy walks off.</sd><char dialog="(at the boy's back) This isn't fair. This is address discrimination!" name="ELAINE" /><set>(Another Street)</set><sd>George is standing outside a store, looking preoccupied. Jerry emerges from the</sd><sd>store with a carrier bag full of stuff.</sd><char dialog="Well, I cleaned out their whole dental hygiene shelf." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="So the plan is to secretly sterilise her mouth?" name="GEORGE" /><sd>They begin to walk along the street.</sd><char dialog="By the time I'm through with her mouth, she'll be able to eat off it. Is" name="JERRY" /><sd>it safe to drink bleach if you dilute it?</sd><char dialog="No, stings the throat. Anyway, so I was coming along here, and I felt" name="GEORGE" /><sd>like a piece of cake, you know? But then I thought, it's morning, I should</sd><sd>really have a muffin. I like those chocolate chip ones. Then I figured, well,</sd><sd>they're really both cake. So I, uh, I sat on that bench for a little while,</sd><sd>twenty minutes or an hour, and then I figured, check and see what you were up</sd><sd>to. (a thought occurs to him) Wait a minute, wait a minute. The broad jump! The</sd><sd>broad jump over the pothole on Eighty-sixth Street!</sd><sd>George dashes off excitedly. Jerry follows, with somewhat less enthusiasm.</sd><set>(Eighty-sixth Street)</set><sd>George is still animatedly leading Jerry along in pursuit of his keys.</sd><char dialog="Now I remember, as I jumped over the hole I heard a, like a jingling" name="GEORGE" /><sd>sound.</sd><char dialog="You didn't look down?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I was trying to stick the landing. (indistinct) ...was right around" name="GEORGE" /><sd>here.</sd><sd>He peers about at the road surface for the pothole. He finds a patch of fresh</sd><sd>tarmac.</sd><char dialog="No! No!!" name="GEORGE" /><sd>A car drives by, running right over the patch.</sd><char dialog="Holy, Holy Cow!" name="HEAD" /><char dialog="Poor son of a bitch." name="JERRY" /><set>(Jenna's Apartment)</set><sd>Jenna is at the sink in her bathroom, using an electric toothbrush which Jerry</sd><sd>has bought her. It's loud.</sd><char dialog="It's a hundred thousand revolutions a second. It's the most powerful one" name="JERRY" /><sd>they make.</sd><char dialog="It's like I'm holding a blender." name="JENNA" /><char dialog="The engine's made by McDonnell-Douglas." name="JERRY" /><sd>Jerry begins to wander into the living room. Jenna switches off the brush.</sd><char dialog="Oh no, you keep going. It shuts off automatically." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="(restarting and reapplying the brush) Really, it does?" name="JENNA" /><char dialog="(unheard by Jenna) When the battery runs out." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="(shouting to Jerry) I was really happy with my old toothbrush." name="JENNA" /><sd>In the living room, Jerry is carefully putting the old brush into a plastic bag,</sd><sd>being very careful not to touch it with his bare skin. He then seals the bag.</sd><char dialog="No, trust me, that one was doing more harm than good. Don't forget to use" name="JERRY" /><sd>the Plax too.</sd><sd>Jenna takes a sip from a glass as if to gargle.</sd><char dialog="That stuff tastes like bleach!" name="JENNA" /><sd>Jerry is looking for a place to put the soiled brush.</sd><char dialog="I don't know anything about that." name="JERRY" /><sd>Just before Jenna emerges from the bathroom, Jerry throws the bag with the brush</sd><sd>out of the window.</sd><char dialog="Mmm. My mouth feels so clean." name="JENNA" /><char dialog="That's the idea." name="JERRY" /><sd>Jenna approaches Jerry, clearly intending to kiss him. As Jenna leans toward</sd><sd>him, Jerry gets a flashback of the toothbrush plunging into the toilet bowl, in</sd><sd>black and white, with portentous music. From his viewpoint, we see Jenna's lips</sd><sd>looming toward him. He looks nauseated by the prospect of the kiss, and pulls</sd><sd>away.</sd><char dialog="You know, maybe we better not. I, I think I'm getting a little cold. I" name="JERRY" /><sd>don't wanna give you any of my germs.</sd><char dialog="Aww. Okay. Thanks, I guess." name="JENNA" /><set>(Jerry's Car)</set><sd>Jerry driving with Elaine in the passenger seat.</sd><char dialog="You still couldn't kiss her?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="She has a taint. I can't see it, but I know it's there." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Oh, so now you're finding fault on a sub-atomic level." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Maybe if I could shrink myself down, like in Fantastic Voyage, and get" name="JERRY" /><sd>inside a microscopic submarine, I could be sure. Although if there was something</sd><sd>there, it might be pretty scary. Course, I would have that laser.</sd><char dialog="Jer, do you see where this is going?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Being really clean and happy?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Jerry, you have tendencies. They're always annoying, but they were just" name="ELAINE" /><sd>tendencies. But now, if you can't kiss this girl, I'm afraid we're talking</sd><sd>disorder.</sd><char dialog="Disorder?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="And from disorder, you're a quirk or two away from full-on dementia." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="(thoughtful) Hmm, that could hurt me. (pointing out of window) Hey, there" name="JERRY" /><sd>it is.</sd><sd>We see Jerry and Elaine's view of the road signs. 'Mile 114' 'Adopt-a-Highway'</sd><sd>and 'Litter removal next 1 Mile KRAMER'.</sd><char dialog="Shall we stop and say hi?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Nah, we've seen it." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah." name="ELAINE" /><set>(Mile 114)</set><sd>Kramer is standing on the verge beside a large pile of plastic bags full of</sd><sd>trash, a couple of brooms lean against the crash barrier. He has an armful of</sd><sd>assorted garbage. Jerry's car passes in the traffic, and a brief beep of the</sd><sd>horn is heard.</sd><char dialog="(shouting after car) Hey Jerry! Yeah, I'll see you back at the house!" name="KRAMER" /><sd>He drops the last handful of trash into a bag.</sd><char dialog="Mile one-fourteen, clean as a whistle." name="KRAMER" /><sd>He claps his hands in satisfaction, and looks out at 'his' road. He notices</sd><sd>something. In the middle of the road is a Coke can, crushed by traffic.</sd><sd>Kramer makes a decision, and dashes out into the traffic to retrieve the can.</sd><sd>His progress to the can is accompanied by the squeal of brakes and the blare of</sd><sd>horns as the traffic passes him. As he reaches the can, one car has to come to a</sd><sd>complete stop. Kramer grabs the can and hurries back to the side of the road,</sd><sd>where he leans on the barrier.</sd><set>(Apartment Building)</set><sd>Elaine is in the hallway of a building, outside Apartment 1A. She knocks at the</sd><sd>door and a guy opens it.</sd><char dialog="Yeah?" name="MAN" /><char dialog="Hi. I'm your neighbour, uh, fr... from across the street. And uh," name="ELAINE" /><sd>(coughs nervously) I was wondering, if it wouldn't be too much trouble, if I</sd><sd>could use your apartment to order some food?</sd><char dialog="Wha? What d'you want?" name="MAN" /><char dialog="You see, there's this certain flounder and they won't deliver it to my" name="ELAINE" /><sd>side of the street.</sd><char dialog="Wh, when is that?" name="MAN" /><char dialog="No, I just need them to deliver it here and I have to be kinda inside is" name="ELAINE" /><sd>all.</sd><char dialog="Who are you with?" name="MAN" /><char dialog="No, actually I'm... I'm just kind of hungry." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Who let you in?" name="MAN" /><char dialog="Well, the lock was broken. You just have to jiggle it, actually. But, I" name="ELAINE" /><sd>just need like a half an hour to an hour.</sd><sd>The man shuts the door in her face.</sd><sd>Elaine turns to leave, and as she does she sees an unmarked door opposite which</sd><sd>stands open. She crosses over for a closer look. It's clearly a janitor's</sd><sd>closet, with the usual fixings. A thought occurs to Elaine, and a smile comes to</sd><sd>her face.</sd><set>(Jerry's Apartment)</set><sd>Jerry has just entered and is removing his coat. Kramer is in the kitchen</sd><sd>cleaning highway signs in the sink.</sd><char dialog="What's with the signs?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Hey, you should see the Berkhardt, Jerry. My mile is spotless. I mean" name="KRAMER" /><sd>the big stuff was easy. Cinderblocks, air-conditioners, shopping carts (makes</sd><sd>sound - fzup!), I just rolled 'em into the woods.</sd><char dialog="Yeah, that stuff's all natural anyway." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="(holding up a sign) Speed limit, one hundred and sixty-five miles per" name="KRAMER" /><sd>hour.

And I been calling the city all day. Course there's not really" name="GEORGE" /><sd>a number to call if you wanna make a pothole.</sd><char dialog="I guess they leave that up to the general population." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I tell you this. If the real Phil Rizzuto was down there, this wouldn't" name="GEORGE" /><sd>be happening!</sd><char dialog="Hard to say." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Hey, you need some roadwork done? 'Cos I met some maintenance guys today" name="KRAMER" /><sd>on the highway, they could probably help you out.</sd><char dialog="Really?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Oh yeah, yeah. I borrowed some cones from them when I was sweeping my" name="KRAMER" /><sd>car-pool lane.</sd><sd>The buzzer buzzes.</sd><char dialog="Yeah?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="It's Jenna." name="JENNA" /><sd>Jerry buzzes Jenna in, opens the door and indicates to George and Kramer that</sd><sd>their presence is no longer required.</sd><char dialog="If you guys wouldn't mind, I would like to ward off dementia." name="JERRY" /><sd>George and Kramer leave, still discussing the maintenance guys.</sd><char dialog="You think you could hook me up with these guys?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Oh yeah, yeah. Give me a ring tomorrow. I'm gonna be at emergency" name="KRAMER" /><sd>callbox seven-eight-four.</sd><char dialog="Seven-eight-four." name="GEORGE" /><sd>Jenna enters.</sd><char dialog="Hey." name="JENNA" /><char dialog="Hi." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="How you feeling?" name="JENNA" /><char dialog="Good. My cold's gone, and I've been looking forwards to kissing you," name="JERRY" /><sd>which I'm ready to do now, if you are ready.</sd><sd>Jenna moves in for the kiss. As she leans towards Jerry, he gets that revolted</sd><sd>look on his again and turns his face away.</sd><char dialog="What?!" name="JENNA" /><char dialog="Nothing. I just, I uh, I bruised my lip. I was drinking a Celray, and I" name="JERRY" /><sd>brought it up too fast and I banged it into my lip, (lower voice and hurriedly)</sd><sd>and then I knocked your toothbrush into the toilet and I wasn't able to tell you</sd><sd>before you could use it.</sd><char dialog="What?" name="JENNA" /><char dialog="I'm sorry." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="When were you gonna tell me this?!" name="JENNA" /><char dialog="Obviously never." name="JERRY" /><sd>The door opens and Kramer enters.</sd><char dialog="I need the yield sign." name="KRAMER" /><sd>Kramer goes and begins to gather the signs from the kitchen.</sd><char dialog="Kramer, I'm kind of in the middle of something. Would you get these signs" name="JERRY" /><sd>out of here, please?</sd><sd>Kramer brings his signs from the kitchen and Jerry picks up those which were on</sd><sd>his table. Together they carry them across the hall to Kramer's apartment.</sd><char dialog="You could've introduced me." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="I wouldn't know where to start." name="JERRY" /><sd>As Jerry is about to return to his apartment, the door is slammed shut. He tries</sd><sd>to open it, but it has been locked.</sd><char dialog="(knocking) Hey, Jenna. Hey!" name="JERRY" /><sd>Jenna opens the door, she has her jacket in her hand and is ready to leave.</sd><char dialog="There. Now something of yours has been in the toilet." name="JENNA" /><char dialog="What?! Wha... what'd you put in there?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Gotta run." name="JENNA" /><sd>Jenna departs, leaving Jerry looking around him. He's wide-eyed, looking panicky</sd><sd>and disgusted.</sd><char dialog="Oh, man!" name="JERRY" /><set>(Jerry's Apartment)</set><sd>Jerry is on the phone. His table is covered with bottles of cleaning fluids,</sd><sd>disinfectants, etc.. He is wearing a rubber glove to hold a spatula. Elaine is</sd><sd>eating an apple and watching him.</sd><char dialog="(into phone) Hello, Jenna, did you dunk the spatula? Was it the spatula?" name="JERRY" /><sd>Hello? Dammit!</sd><sd>Frustrated, he throws the spatula into the waste bin.</sd><char dialog="She won't even give you a hint?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="No. Could be anything. The whole apartment's a biohazard." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="You know what I bet it is? (points) Your remote." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Yes, that is a definite possibility." name="JERRY" /><sd>He picks up the remote control and drops it into a waste bin.</sd><char dialog="(walking to the couch) Or, could be your walkman there." name="ELAINE" /><sd>Jerry picks up the walkman and begins to deposit it in the trash, then a thought</sd><sd>occurs to him. Elaine sits on the couch and picks up the phone.</sd><char dialog="Are you just screwing with me?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah, I am." name="ELAINE" /><sd>Jerry thinks for a second, then he throws the walkman in the garbage anyway.</sd><sd>Kramer enters carrying a box.</sd><char dialog="Hey ah." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Hey, how's life on the road?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Oh, I'm making a difference Jerry." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="I don't doubt it." name="JERRY" /><sd>Kramer puts his box on the kitchen counter.</sd><char dialog="You should see the smiles on the drivers' faces.

His alarm goes off, and the radio comes on in the middle of</sd><sd>the traffic report. Kramer wakes up and listens.</sd><char dialog="Hey, and if you're heading north on the Arthur Berkhardt, whoah Nelly," name="RADIO" /><sd>for some reason four lanes are converging into two, instantaneously right at</sd><sd>mile-marker one-fourteen. I don't know what that is, but the A-B's a parking lot</sd><sd>out there. Somebody screwed up on that one.</sd><sd>By the end of the report, Kramer looks slightly worried.</sd><set>(Janitor's Closet)</set><sd>Elaine stands waiting in the closet. There's the usual paraphernalia - buckets,</sd><sd>brooms, cleaning materials, stepladder, boxes, etc.. There's a knock at the</sd><sd>door. Elaine opens it to find Jerry.</sd><char dialog="Oh it's you." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Is the flounder here yet?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No, it's not here yet. You want the tour?" name="ELAINE" /><sd>Jerry enters, and Elaine closes the door.</sd><char dialog="(gesturing) There's this." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Nice. French doors'd really open this place up. Oh, but you have a" name="JERRY" /><sd>slop-bucket.</sd><sd>There's another knock at the door.</sd><char dialog="(gleeful) The fish!" name="ELAINE" /><sd>She opens the door to find George. He's wearing a tartan workshirt.</sd><char dialog="Ah, what're you doing here?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Hey." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Hey." name="JERRY" /><sd>George joins Jerry and Elaine in the closet. It's getting a bit cramped.</sd><char dialog="Oh, I was uh, I was waiting downstairs for the jackhammer, thought I'd" name="GEORGE" /><sd>drop by.</sd><char dialog="Kramer's guys?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah. I got 'em down to fifty bucks. I just have to do all the" name="GEORGE" /><sd>jackhammering myself.</sd><char dialog="Oh that's nice, kind of a hard-labour fantasy camp." name="JERRY" /><sd>The door is pushed open from the outside. It thumps into George who is pushed</sd><sd>into Elaine, who stumbles into Jerry.</sd><char dialog="Ow!" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Uh, man!" name="ELAINE" /><sd>Kramer enters the now crowded closet.</sd><char dialog="Huh, yeah. (looks round) Oh, sweet setup. Elaine, d'you have any paint" name="KRAMER" /><sd>thinner? I need like uh, forty gallons.</sd><char dialog="I'm plumb out." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Oh man, if I don't get that black paint off the City's gonna go ape. I" name="KRAMER" /><sd>don't wanna lose my baby!</sd><sd>There's yet another knock at the door. More strident.</sd><char dialog="Janitor?" name="MRS ALLISTER" /><char dialog="(to the guys) Uh, Mrs Allister. (louder) Yeah, uh, just coming Mrs" name="ELAINE" /><sd>Allister. (to guys) Okay, I've gotta get out.</sd><sd>Elaine struggle to squeeze past George, and then Kramer to reach the door. The</sd><sd>she has to make room to swing the door inwards.</sd><char dialog="Here, can you move, you gotta move from the door." name="ELAINE" /><sd>She succeeds in squeezing out, and stumbles into the hallway. The crush behind</sd><sd>her slams the door shut.</sd><char dialog="Hi, I uhm... What can I do for you?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="I told you yesterday to haul that trash outta the basement." name="MRS ALLISTER" /><char dialog="Yeah, I am so sorry." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Some of the children have been playing near it and putting it in" name="MRS ALLISTER" /><sd>their mouths.</sd><char dialog="Well, a lot of it is vegetable..." name="ELAINE" /><sd>In the closet, the guys are struggling together with equipment and supplies in</sd><sd>the cramped space. The thumps of their movements can be heard in the hallway.</sd><char dialog="Get that stuff outta there today, or you'll be outta here." name="MRS ALLISTER" /><sd>Understand?</sd><char dialog="(meekly) Yes ma'am." name="ELAINE" /><sd>The janitor's closet door opens and the guys stumble out.</sd><char dialog="...stop pushing.

It is clear that Jerry</sd><sd>has gone overboard in his efforts to dispose of whatever was contaminated - his</sd><sd>kitchen shelves are bare, and most other surfaces are free of the usual</sd><sd>knick-knacks.</sd><char dialog="So Jerry, why'd you call me?" name="JENNA" /><char dialog="Well, I thought it's about time we put aside all this silliness. I know" name="JERRY" /><sd>now you didn't put anything in my toilet bowl. (pause) Did you?</sd><char dialog="Yes, I did." name="JENNA" /><char dialog="Well, whatever. So, how've you been?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Good." name="JENNA" /><char dialog="Good. (pause) Steak knife?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Just eating away at you isn't it?" name="JENNA" /><char dialog="Nah." name="JERRY" /><sd>The door opens and Elaine enters.</sd><char dialog="Hi." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Hi." name="JENNA" /><char dialog="Hi." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Hi. Jerry, can I borrow your car?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="For what?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I have to haul some dirty garbage to the dump." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Dirt? That's alright, (for Jenna's benefit) because there's nothing wrong" name="JERRY" /><sd>with dirt.</sd><char dialog="Well, actually it's pretty grimy." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Grime, grease, filth, funk, ooze. Whatever it is, you take that stuff and" name="JERRY" /><sd>put it right on my leather upholstery.</sd><sd>He hands the keys to Elaine.</sd><char dialog="Well, I don't know who you are, but thanks for the car." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Sure. Bye." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Bye." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Bye." name="JENNA" /><char dialog="Bye." name="ELAINE" /><sd>Elaine leaves.</sd><char dialog="There, you see? I just leant her my car, and she's gonna fill it with all" name="JERRY" /><sd>sorts of... (he cracks) Alright! You win! That car was my last germ-free</sd><sd>sanctuary. I slept there last night! Now, for the love of God, please, what is</sd><sd>it? What is it?!</sd><char dialog="Toilet brush." name="JENNA" /><char dialog="Toilet brush, oh (he pulls a 'Damn, shoulda guessed!' face). Alright, I" name="JERRY" /><sd>can replace that.</sd><char dialog="You wanna order dinner?" name="JENNA" /><char dialog="Yeah. Let's uh, go to your place. Because I, threw out all my dishes." name="JERRY" /><set>(Eighty-sixth Street)</set><sd>Elaine strides along the sidewalk looking very blue-collar in overalls and cap,</sd><sd>grimy face, etc. She has some old carpet slung over one shoulder and some paint</sd><sd>cans in her hand. A jackhammer can be heard. As she walks along, she passes</sd><sd>George who is holding the jackhammer. She nods acknowledgment and he touches the</sd><sd>peak of his hardhat. George gives the pothole a burst from the jackhammer.</sd><set>(Street)</set><sd>Kramer struggles to lift a forty-gallon drum into the boot of his car. He</sd><sd>eventually heaves it in.</sd><set>(Jenna's Apartment)</set><sd>Jerry and Jenna, sitting on the couch, eating and conversing (looks like Chinese</sd><sd>food).</sd><char dialog="That's true." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Mm." name="JENNA" /><char dialog="But, I'll tell you this much. I am never going to let some silly hygienic" name="JERRY" /><sd>mishap get in the way of, what could be, a meaningful, long-lasting</sd><sd>relationship.</sd><set>(Eighty-sixth Street)</set><sd>George is giving the street a long burst from the jackhammer. Suddenly, there is</sd><sd>a clang. George stops hammering, and listens. There is a deep rumbling sound,</sd><sd>from beneath his feet, which seems to be getting louder. He looks around for the</sd><sd>source of the noise.</sd><set>(Jenna's Apartment)</set><sd>Jenna and Jerry are still eating on the couch. The rumbling noise can be heard,</sd><sd>though not so loud as outside. Then, in the bathroom, the toilet starts to</sd><sd>rattle.</sd><char dialog="Do you hear something?" name="JENNA" /><sd>They both listen intently. The rumble continues and, in the bathroom, the toilet</sd><sd>rattles again, the cistern shaking.</sd><char dialog="I don't know what that could be." name="JERRY" /><sd>Jenna gets up and goes to the bathroom door.</sd><set>(Eighty-sixth Street)</set><sd>There is a rending sound, and a huge jet of water erupts from the ground right</sd><sd>in front of George, where he was hammering. There is a shot from above the</sd><sd>rising column of water. On the top rises George's keyring.</sd><char dialog="Holy cow!" name="HEAD" /><sd>The plume of water rises high above George, who can be seen looking up at the</sd><sd>height of it.</sd><set>(Jenna's Apartment)</set><sd>In the bathroom, Jenna is peering curiously at her rattling toilet, wondering</sd><sd>what's wrong. She leans toward the bowl. Jerry is in the living room, still</sd><sd>talking to her.</sd><char dialog="Anyway, I'm a new man, and I'm looking towards the future. Clean, dirty," name="JERRY" /><sd>whatever.</sd><sd>There is the sound of a wet explosion and splashing water, followed by Jenna</sd><sd>screaming in the bathroom. Jerry leaps to his feet and rushes to see what has</sd><sd>happened.</sd><sd>Jerry enters the bathroom and sees Jenna. Only her forearm is visible to us, but</sd><sd>it's enough for us to know that she is wringing wet as the result of a violent</sd><sd>eruption from the toilet bowl.</sd><sd>Jerry's face registers his obvious distaste. He shrugs, sorry.</sd><char dialog="Holy cow! Have a nice life." name="JERRY" /><sd>He closes the bathroom door as he leaves.</sd><set>(Jerry's Car)</set><sd>Elaine driving. The passenger seats are piled with the garbage from the basement</sd><sd>- old carpets, bits of timber, boxes, etc. An external shot of the car reveals</sd><sd>she is driving on Kramer's section of road, as the black-painted lane markers</sd><sd>can be seen.</sd><char dialog="Hey, look at this. Wide lanes. This is so luxurious. Woo, yeah." name="ELAINE" /><sd>We see the Saab weave across the extra wide lanes. From the boot falls a</sd><sd>battered sewing machine. It sits in the middle of the carriageway.</sd><set>(Arthur Berkhardt Expressway)</set><sd>Kramer is manhandling the forty gallon drum out of his boot. He struggles to</sd><sd>heave it clear, and then he drops it. The drum falls onto its side, and the lid</sd><sd>comes off, spilling the contents across the road.</sd><char dialog="Bugger!" name="KRAMER" /><set>(Newman's Truck)</set><sd>Newman is singing as he drives. Beside him are a stack of boxes, marked 'Fresh</sd><sd>Fish'.</sd><char dialog="(sings) You're once. Twice. Three times a lady." name="NEWMAN" /><sd>There's a loud crash as the truck runs over the sewing machine. Tyres squeal as</sd><sd>Newman regains control.</sd><char dialog="What the hell was that?" name="NEWMAN" /><sd>The truck is travelling along with the sewing machine caught on the front axle.</sd><sd>As it scrapes along the road, it leaves a huge trail of sparks behind.</sd><set>(Arthur Berkhardt Expressway)</set><sd>Kramer rights the empty drum and does a double-take as he notices the warning</sd><sd>labels on the side - 'Paint Thinner' 'Highly Flammable'.</sd><char dialog="Double bugger!" name="KRAMER" /><set>(Newman's Truck)</set><sd>Newman still singing, although the grinding sound of the sewing machine is</sd><sd>almost drowning out his voice. The sewing machine is still producing a shower of</sd><sd>sparks under the truck.</sd><char dialog="(sings) Yes, you're once. Twice. Three times..." name="NEWMAN" /><sd>Suddenly, the truck clearly reaches the pool of thinner and the sparks ignite</sd><sd>it. Flames shoot up around the truck, and are reflected in the windows. Newman</sd><sd>begins screaming and yelling in the midst of the inferno.</sd><char dialog="Aaah! Aaagh! Aah-aah. Oh, oh the humanity! Aaagh!" name="NEWMAN" /><set>(Arthur Berkhardt Expressway)</set><sd>Kramer finally manages to get the drum back into his boot and slams the lid</sd><sd>down. Then he sees Newman staggering along the road. Newman is walking stiffly,</sd><sd>and is singed all over, with blackened patches on his hair and clothing. He's</sd><sd>staring ahead, clearly in such a state of shock that he's uncomprehending of his</sd><sd>surroundings.</sd><char dialog="Hey buddy. What're you doing out here?" name="KRAMER" /><sd>Newman continues to walk, oblivious of Kramer.</sd><char dialog="Man, did you see that fireball? Woo-hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo." name="KRAMER" /><sd>Newman still doesn't respond. In the distance the sound of sirens can be heard.</sd><sd>Kramer hears them, looks worried, and moves toward the car.</sd><char dialog="Hey, I gotta skedaddle. You wanna lift?" name="KRAMER" /><sd>Kramer has the driver's door open and is impatient to be off. The sirens</sd><sd>continue.</sd><char dialog="Newman! Newman!!" name="KRAMER" /><sd>Kramer gets in the car and leans out of the window to call to Newman.</sd><char dialog="Well, I'll meet you at the coffee shop." name="KRAMER" /><sd>He starts the car, and leaves with a squeal of protesting tyres. Newman</sd><sd>continues his walk.</sd><sd>As the Castle Rock logo comes up, Newman can be heard screaming 'Aargh!'.</sd><char dialog="" name="THE END" /></root>
