That's what surfing is. Surfing is the ocean</sd><sd>throwing us out of itself, you see? We keep trying to paddle in, the</sd><sd>ocean's saying, "No you don't." The ocean is like a nightclub and the</sd><sd>waves are bouncers tossin' us out. The undertow's like a really mean</sd><sd>bouncer.

I love Hampton tomatoes. You know, you can eat 'em like" name="GEORGE" /><sd>apples. You know it's funny, the tomato never took on as a hand fruit.</sd><char dialog="Well, the tomato's an anomaly. So successful with the ketchup" name="JERRY" /><sd>and the sauce, but you can't find a good one. (Kramer enters with a box of</sd><sd>lobster)</sd><char dialog="Hey, hey, hey!

So anytime you want you can just visualize her" name="GEORGE" /><sd>naked.</sd><char dialog="I guess that's true..." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Stop it, stop it! It's not fair. It's not fair. I don't like" name="GEORGE" /><sd>this situation, Jerry. I don't like it one bit.</sd><char dialog="What do you want me to do? You wanna see Rachel naked?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yes, yes! The punishment should fit the crime." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="You can see me naked. I can offer you that." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="It's like I'm Neil Armstrong. I turn around for a sip of Tang and" name="GEORGE" /><sd>you jump out first.</sd><char dialog="Nobody ever called me breathtaking before." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="I've never been called breathtaking either." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I mean, if he thinks that that baby's breathtaking, then who's not" name="ELAINE" /><sd>breathtaking?</sd><char dialog="Maybe he just said it because the mother was in the room." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah, right, that's a possibility. I have to find out." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="How are you gonna do that?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I can be very clever." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="I'm gonna take a swim." name="RACHEL" /><char dialog="Oh, me too. I'll meet you down. (She goes in the hall and sees" name="ELAINE" /><sd>George) Oh, don't go in, Rachel's getting undressed.</sd><char dialog="Oh, okay. (Starts to walk other way and then walks to their room" name="GEORGE" /><sd>and goes in)</sd><char dialog="Hey!" name="RACHEL" /><char dialog="Oh, sorry." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Don't you knock?" name="RACHEL" /><char dialog="I'm sorry, uh, it's not like I'm gonna see something I've never" name="GEORGE" /><sd>seen before.</sd><char dialog="You might have." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I didn't." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="You won't." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="What'd you want anyway, George?" name="RACHEL" /><char dialog="Yes, George. I'm kind of wondering myself. What is it what you" name="JERRY" /><sd>want?</sd><char dialog="No, I was just wondering... if you guys, uh, had any gum." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Oh! So you were swimming in the pool, and you wanted some gum." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yes, because the water was cold... and the chewing warms me up." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="We don't have any gum." name="RACHEL" /><char dialog="Okay. (Chewing) Thanks anyway. (Continues to chew as he exits)" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Strange man." name="RACHEL" /><char dialog="Wait'll you get to know him." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="So where is this baby, anyway?" name="RACHEL" /><char dialog="Oh, check it out. I guarantee you've never seen anything quite so" name="JERRY" /><sd>objectionable. It's down the hall, third door on your left. (Rachel walks</sd><sd>down hall, walks in on George changing out of his swimsuit)</sd><char dialog="(She screams) Oh my God! I'm sorry, I thought this was the baby's" name="RACHEL" /><sd>room. I'm really sorry. (She exits)</sd><char dialog="I was in the pool! I was in the pool!" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Did she do it on purpose?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="It was my fault, I told her the wrong door." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I was supposed to see her. She wasn't supposed to see me." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="So what?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Well ordinarily I wouldn't mind. But..." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="But..." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Well I just got back from swimming in the pool. And the water was" name="GEORGE" /><sd>cold...</sd><char dialog="Oh... You mean... shrinkage." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yes. Significant shrinkage!" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="So you feel you were short changed." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yes! I mean, if she thinks that's me she's under a complete" name="GEORGE" /><sd>misapprehension. That was not me, Jerry. That was not me.</sd><char dialog="Well, so what's the difference?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="What if she discusses it with Jane?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Oh, she's not gonna tell Jane." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="How do you know?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Women aren't like us." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="They're worse! They're much worse than us, they talk about" name="GEORGE" /><sd>everything! Couldn't you at least tell her about the shrinkage factor?</sd><char dialog="No, I'm not gonna tell her about your shrinkage. Besides, I think" name="JERRY" /><sd>women know about shrinkage.</sd><char dialog="How do women know about shrinkage? (They see Elaine walking down" name="GEORGE" /><sd>the hall) Elaine! Get! (She enters) Do women know about shrinkage?</sd><char dialog="What do you mean, like laundry?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="No." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Like when a man goes swimming... afterwards..." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="It shrinks?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Like a frightened turtle!" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Why does it shrink?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="It just does." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I don't know how you guys walk around with those things." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Thanks for the lobster, Kramer." name="MICHAEL" /><char dialog="Rachel, aren't you gonna have any?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Oh, no, I can't. I'm kosher, we don't eat shellfish." name="RACHEL" /><char dialog="You mean you've never tasted lobster?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="No." name="RACHEL" /><char dialog="Wow. You're so pious. I really respect that. You know when you" name="KRAMER" /><sd>die, you're gonna get some special attention.</sd><char dialog="Oh, the baby's crying. I'll go get him. He can sit with us." name="CAROL" /><char dialog="No!" name="ELAINE + JERRY" /><char dialog="No, you don't wanna do that. You'll be uncomfortable." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah, finish eating. The baby's not gonna have any fun over here." name="ELAINE" /><sd>We're not fun for a baby.</sd><char dialog="Yeah, the lobster'll scare him." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I'm gonna get him." name="CAROL" /><char dialog="See, look at this. Rachel, my T-shirt shrunk. It used to be much" name="GEORGE" /><sd>bigger, and now it shrunk. You see, that's what water does. It shrinks</sd><sd>things.</sd><char dialog="Really? Tell us more, Mr. Science. (Rachel whispers in Jane's" name="ELAINE" /><sd>ear, which prompts Jane to laugh)</sd><char dialog="What're you doing? What're you, telling secrets? What're you" name="GEORGE" /><sd>laughing at?</sd><char dialog="It's nothing, George." name="JANE" /><char dialog="You know, it's very impolite to tell secrets. Are you talking" name="GEORGE" /><sd>about me?</sd><char dialog="What is it with you?" name="JANE" /><char dialog="(To George) Easy big fella." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="So Kramer, where'd you get all these lobster, at the" name="MICHAEL" /><sd>Fleesher's Market?</sd><char dialog="No, I got 'em in the ocean." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="The ocean? What'd you mean?" name="MICHAEL" /><char dialog="Well, I found this rope and I kept tugging on it, and all these" name="KRAMER" /><sd>lobsters came up.</sd><char dialog="Those are commercial lobster traps. You can't take those" name="MICHAEL" /><sd>lobsters from there. That's against the law.</sd><char dialog="Take it easy. There's plenty of lobsters in the ocean for" name="KRAMER" /><sd>everyone.</sd><char dialog="My father was a lobsterman. He got up every morning at" name="MICHAEL" /><sd>four and came home every night stinking of brine. He sent me through law</sd><sd>school with the lobsters he caught! (Kramer stands up from table)</sd><char dialog="(Entering with baby) Here he is." name="CAROL" /><char dialog="Ahhh! (Falls to floor as he sees the baby)" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Some night, huh?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Yeah, I wish I had my telescope." name="BEN" /><char dialog="Some dinner, huh?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Nothing like fresh caught lobster." name="BEN" /><char dialog="Some house, huh?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="It was built by Mark Farman." name="BEN" /><char dialog="Some ugly baby, huh?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="What did you say?" name="BEN" /><char dialog="I said, uh, some snuggly baby." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="He is something." name="BEN" /><char dialog="Well, to tell you the truth, Dr. Feffa, I , I was surprised to hear" name="ELAINE" /><sd>you use a word like breathtaking to describe a baby, I mean, because you</sd><sd>also used it referring to me.</sd><char dialog="Well, you know Elaine, sometimes you say things just to be" name="BEN" /><sd>nice. (Elaine relieved, then confused, not knowing if he was being nice to</sd><sd>her or to the baby)</sd><char dialog="You told her?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah, what's the big deal?" name="RACHEL" /><char dialog="You don't understand. This organ, it's very... schizophrenic." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Jerry, what the difference? You know, you're the ones obsessed" name="RACHEL" /><sd>with this stuff, not us. I'm sure it wouldn't matter to Jane.</sd><char dialog="You're going back to New York now?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Yeah, I have some things to do." name="JANE" /><char dialog="Uh huh. Uh huh! I think you spoke to your little friend Rachel," name="GEORGE" /><sd>that's what I think.</sd><char dialog="So what if I did?" name="JANE" /><char dialog="And she didn't say something to you about a certain something?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I don't know what you're talking about." name="JANE" /><char dialog="*I* think that *you* think that a certain *something* is not all" name="GEORGE" /><sd>that it could be, when in fact it is is all that it *should* be, and</sd><sd>*more*!</sd><char dialog="I'm sure it is." name="JANE" /><char dialog="Look, you don't understand. There was shrinkage." name="GEORGE" /><sd>fridge and Kramer lights up a cigar.</sd><char dialog="Looking for this? (Holding up lobster)" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Oh, Kramer! You startled me." name="RACHEL" /><char dialog="Well, I thought you might wind up around here." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Yeah, well, I couldn't stop thinking about how everyone was" name="RACHEL" /><sd>enjoying the lobster so much. I thought I little taste wouldn't hurt, huh?</sd><char dialog="I'm afraid I couldn't do that." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Why not?" name="RACHEL" /><char dialog="Well, that wouldn't be kosher." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="C'mon, Kramer. I really want to try it." name="RACHEL" /><char dialog="Nah, I'm sorry, honey. Not on my watch." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Come on, Kramer." name="RACHEL" /><char dialog="Heyahhh!" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="I just heard a car drive out. What was that?" name="RACHEL" /><char dialog="Oh, that's just Jane driving home to New York in the middle of the" name="JERRY" /><sd>night.

This is so good." name="RACHEL" /><char dialog="Ah, enjoying them?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Mm-hmm." name="RACHEL" /><char dialog="Uh, good.
