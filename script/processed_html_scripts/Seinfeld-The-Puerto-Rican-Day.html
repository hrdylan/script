JERRY'S CAR - DAY" /><sd>The gang drives along in Jerry's car with the top down. Elaine and Kramer sit in the back, George is shotgun, and Jerry behind the wheel.</sd><char dialog="Man, I'm starving." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="How can you be hungry after what you ate at that Mets game?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Because ballpark food doesn't count as real food." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Right. It's just an activity. It's like that paddle with the ball and the rubber band." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="You know, my friend Bob Saccamano made a fortune off of those. See he came up with the idea for the rubber band. Before that, people would just hit the ball, and it would fly away." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="I can't believe you all made me leave before the end of the game." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Oh, come on, Jerry. It was 9 to nothing. We were getting shellacked." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Those nachos are killing me." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I thought you were hungry." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="It's complicated." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Come on, Jerry, you're going to miss the exit." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Keep your shirt on. I got it." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Watch out for that maroon Golf." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Oh, boy." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Look at this guy.

Go--ahh..." name="KRAMER" /><sd>Jerry swerves into another lane. Lamar, the driver of the maroon Golf honks the horn.</sd><char dialog="Oh, calm down, maroon Golf. He thinks I cut him off. He accelerated." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="You want me to moon him? Ooh, let's moon him. Roll up your window. Let's do a pressed ham under glass." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Oh, no, I couldn't do that." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Look at this, look at this. He's giving us the finger." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Oh, all right." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Yeah." name="KRAMER" /><sd>Elaine and Kramer get up to moon Lamar.</sd><char dialog="" name="INT.

What's that called?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Blimp: The Hindenburg Story." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="How was it?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I found it morose. Why dwell on these negative themes?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Yeah. They should make a movie about all the Hindenburg flights that made it." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Anyway, right in the middle, the ship blows up-- burning debris, bodies falling-- and then just as this eerie silence settles over the airfield, I yelled out, &quot;That's gotta hurt!&quot;" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Heh." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="The place went nuts." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Imagine the laugh you could have gotten if you'd yelled that out at the actual disaster." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Why are we slowing down?" name="KRAMER" /><sd>Music plays in the background.</sd><char dialog="What is that music?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="What's with all these flags?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Oh, no." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="It's the Puerto Rican Day parade!" name="ELAINE AND JERRY" /><char dialog="Ohh!

If we had stayed, we could have seen those runs." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I could have had some ice cream. I think that might have calmed down the nachos." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I'm going to miss 60 Minutes. You know, I hate to miss 60 Minutes. It's part of my Sunday weekend wind-down." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="I don't know how you can unwind with that clock ticking. It makes me anxious." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="All right, gentlemen, I scouted it out. I think we can get out over there." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="But that's a one-way street coming this way. Besides, how am I gonna get all the way over there?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Just inch over. You worm your way." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Just do it, Jerry. Uhh. This exhaust. I'm gonna throw up." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="You know, you should make yourself throw up." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Huh?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="You know you're going to." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="All right, I'm worming." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Hey, Jerry. You know who the grand marshal is of this thing? None other than Miss Chita Rivera." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="They're not letting me in." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="My hand is out." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Well, I think we're gonna need more than a hand. They have to see a human face." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="You sure you want his face?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="No, no, no. It was Mar&#237;a Conchita Alonso." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="This guy's giving me the stare-ahead." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="The stare-ahead. I hate that. I use it all the time." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Look at me! I am man! I am you!" name="GEORGE" /><sd>The man in the other car looks over at George. Elaine, sitting behind George, aids in the cause by pleading to the man by mouthing the words, "Hi, can we go in?"</sd><char dialog="All right, he's letting you in. Thank you! Creep." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Oh! I know who it is. Stacy Keach." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="One more lane to go." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="All right!

My old buddy, black Saab." name="LAMAR" /><char dialog="Maroon Golf." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Where you goin', black Saab? You seem to be a tad askew." name="LAMAR" /><char dialog="Could you move your car back a little?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Oh. Sorry. I seem to have cut you off." name="LAMAR" /><char dialog="All right, I think I know where this is going, and I am going somewhere else." name="ELAINE" /><sd>Elaine pushes George's seat forward slamming his head onto the dashboard. She gets out.</sd><char dialog="You can't do that. You can't just leave the group." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I've been trying to leave this group for 10 years. Vaya con dios." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="&#191;Con dios? Well, that's rude." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Can you believe her?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah.

Like what you do." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="That's not what I do." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Isn't it?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Maybe a little. Ah, hell, I guess it is." name="JERRY" /><sd>George leaves.</sd><char dialog="You know, actually, Jerry, you haven't worked a room that big in a while." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Taxis stuck in traffic." name="STOCK FOOTAGE" /><char dialog="" name="INT.

JERRY'S CAR - DAY" /><sd>Kramer and Jerry sit listening to the radio.</sd><sd>RADIO What a comeback for the New York Mets-- 6 runs in the bottom of the ninth.</sd><char dialog="I've gotta see this game. If it wasn't for this guy, we could get out of here." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="This traffic's a killer, ain't it?" name="LAMAR" /><char dialog="You want to get outta here? Here's what we do. We leave the car here, we take the plates off, we scratch the serial number off the engine block, and we walk away." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Walk away?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="You've got insurance. You tell them that the car was stolen, and then you get another one free." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Isn't there a deductible?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="All right, what is your deductible?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="I don't know." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yes, because they've already deducted it." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="From what?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="The car, which we're leaving. So the net is zero. See you pocket the money, if there is any, and you get a new car." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="We're not leaving the car!" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="All right. If you refuse to grow up and scam your insurance company, you'll have to work this out with maroon Golf." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Absolutely not.

I never meet anyone funny." name="LADY 2" /><char dialog="I know. A sense of humor is so much more important to me than looks or hair." name="LADY 1" /><char dialog="Mmm, yeah." name="LADY 2" /><sd>There's an explosion on the screen. The laser moves around the screen and everyone laughs.</sd><char dialog="That's gotta hurt!" name="GEORGE" /><sd>Everyone stops laughing.</sd><char dialog="It's...gotta hurt! Hurt!

CITY STREET - DAY" /><sd>Kramer is talking to Lamar while Jerry waits in his car. Kramer walks to Jerry.</sd><char dialog="Ok, here's the deal. He wants you to acknowledge that you cut him off with an &quot;I am sorry&quot; wave." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="What's that?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="You raise the hand, lower the head-- &quot;I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

Praise the lord. But I'll take it." name="LAMAR" /><char dialog="Yes! All right, Lamar, back it up a little bit so we can get out now." name="KRAMER" /><sd>Kramer gets in the car.

We were almost out!" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="So that was your girlfriend that blocked you in. That's real good." name="LAMAR" /><char dialog="I'm not his girlfriend. Well, actually, we used to date, but not anymore." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Elaine, he doesn't need-" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Used to date?
