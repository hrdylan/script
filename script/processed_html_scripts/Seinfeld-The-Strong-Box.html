My Tony, my... military discharge." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="You were in the Army?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Briefly. Now, I gotta find a good place to hide this key.

You mind if I hide this somewhere?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="No, go ahead." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Oh, come on!" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Come on, Jerry, this is a security issue. Boy, you wouldn't last a day in the Army." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Well, that's classified." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Kramer?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No, the Green Lantern." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="" name="OK!" /><char dialog="Well, I don't know.

Thank you, and good night.</sd><char dialog="No, George, we're not." name="MAURA" /><char dialog="But I proved it!" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I refuse to give up on this relationship. It's like launching" name="MAURA" /><sd>missiles from a submarine. Both of use have to turn our keys.</sd><char dialog="Well, then, I am gonna have to ask you to turn your key." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I'm sorry, George, I can't do that." name="MAURA" /><char dialog="Turn your key, Maura.

But I can't" name="JERRY" /><sd>anymore.</sd><char dialog="Nodding off!" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Well, I was right. He's an adulterer. And he's cheating on his wife" name="ELAINE" /><sd>with me.</sd><char dialog="I'm hungry. Can you throw something down?" name="ELAINE" /><sd>are you doin'?</sd><char dialog="You jammed your key in here? You shorted out my intercom!" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="You just had to go lookin' for it, didn't you? See, you hate it that" name="KRAMER" /><sd>I have a little secret.

You have a brown spot." name="MAURA" /><sd>little... love nest?</sd><char dialog="It's nothing special, just a little place I keep." name="GLENN" /><char dialog="Oh." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Ah, should I light a fire?" name="GLENN" /><char dialog="Oh, that sounds romantic. the heat. Uh, I got some cardboard out here." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="This is wrong. I should go." name="ELAINE, IN HER MIND" /><char dialog="Can you get that, please?" name="GLENN, FROM OUTSIDE" /><char dialog="Oh, sure.

You know, I'm" name="ELAINE" /><sd>not really a home-wrecker. I-I-I-I thought he was a superhero. I swear.</sd><char dialog="Lady, I'm not his wife, I'm his welfare caseworker.

He's not married. He's poor.</sd><char dialog="Is he wretchedly poor? Does he wear one of those barrels, with the" name="JERRY" /><sd>straps?</sd><char dialog="He probably busted it up and burned it for heat." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="So, when are you giving Boxcar Willie his walking papers?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="How can I end it over money? I feel bad." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Well, let's think. Have you ever dealt with the poor in any other" name="JERRY" /><sd>situation?</sd><char dialog="Yes. There was this homeless guy who used to urinate on our garbage" name="ELAINE" /><sd>cans.</sd><char dialog="Good. How did you handle that?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Well, we gave him a few bucks, and... now he goes in the alley" name="ELAINE" /><sd>across the street.</sd><char dialog="Same situation. Pay him off, and you're clean." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Well, I am not paying Glenn off to get out of this relationship." name="ELAINE" /><sd>Wh-what am I supposed to do, just walk into his hovel, and hand him... well,</sd><sd>how much do you think it would be?</sd><char dialog="Hey, where have you been?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Seeing Maura. Apparently, I was unable to break up beyond a" name="GEORGE" /><sd>reasonable doubt.</sd><char dialog="If only he could have been cheating on his wife, you know, things" name="ELAINE" /><sd>would have been so much simpler.</sd><char dialog="Who's this, Blue Arrow?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Green Lantern." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="We found out his super power was lack of money." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="All right." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="He's invulnerable to creditors." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="We get it." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="He's the 'Got-no-Green' Lantern." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Thank you." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Hey, Elaine. Maybe his girlfriend is Lois Loan." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Well crafted." name="ELAINE, LEAVING" /><char dialog="Hey, maybe this cheating thing is what I could use to ditch Maura." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Sure, just tell Maura you're having an affair." name="JERRY" /><sd>George, now on the same side as the booth of Jerry, with Elaine's side</sd><char dialog="She's like a district attorney.

How come you never pursued her before?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="She's too tan. It's the middle of the winter, she's like a carrot." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="He can wipe out his checking account in a single bound!" name="JERRY, TO ELAINE" /><sd>(Jerry, as he's entering his apartment to see Kramer there, disturbs some</sd><sd>sort of bird in the hallway, which makes a squawking noise)</sd><char dialog="Hey." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="There's a giant parrot in the hallway." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="It's Phil's." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Who?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Our neighbor that you turned against. Anyway, I told him it'd be" name="KRAMER" /><sd>fine with us if he wanted to let it stretch its wings out in the hallway.</sd><char dialog="What'd ya tell him that for?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Because since you've been playing God with the front door, I've been" name="KRAMER" /><sd>tryin' to smooth things out, Jerry. In fact, I was just hanging out at his</sd><sd>place.</sd><char dialog="Really? What's it like? Is it nicer than mine? Where does he have the" name="JERRY" /><sd>couch?</sd><char dialog="Well, I don't know, but the key problem is solved. I hid it at" name="KRAMER" /><sd>Phil's</sd><char dialog="He let you?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No, he doesn't know. So, uh, Phil won't be compulsively looking for" name="KRAMER" /><sd>it like some people. You!

I don't want to spoil things by sleeping with you too soon." name="LORETTA" /><char dialog="Are you sure? 'Cause it could really help me out of a jam." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I want to build something with you, George." name="LORETTA" /><char dialog="Oh, not more building." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="And I won't take no for an answer." name="LORETTA" /><char dialog="No?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="No." name="LORETTA" /><char dialog="It's a surprise." name="GLENN" /><char dialog="Oh.

What is that?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="It's a bag of donuts." name="GLENN" /><char dialog="It's garbage. the old ones come out right here. your last name? idea how rare this is." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="I'll make it out to cash. How 'bout two hundred bucks? Two-fifty?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Make it three hundred. the garbage can of my life. (the cook comes out again, dumping a bucket of water out in the alley, and" name="ELAINE" /><sd>splashing Elaine and Glenn, but they're too wrapped up with each other to</sd><sd>notice)</sd><sd>Jerry, at Phil's door, which is answered by a woman wearing cleaning gloves</sd><char dialog="Phil... hi.
