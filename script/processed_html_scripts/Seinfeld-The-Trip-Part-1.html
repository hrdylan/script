But you essentially wear the same thing all the time." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Seemingly. Seemingly.

Don't you hate</sd><sd>these things? They come out of nowhere; Beep Beep, cart people, look out, cart</sd><sd>people! Look out! We all scurry out of the way like worthless peasants. Oooh!</sd><sd>It's cart people! I hope we didn't slow you down. Wave to the cart people,</sd><sd>Timmy, they're the best people in the world. Ya know, if you're too fat, slow</sd><sd>and disoriented to get to your gate on time, you're not ready for air travel.</sd><sd>The other people I hate are the people that get on to the moving walkway and</sd><sd>then just stand there.

We know nothing about Eva Braun,</sd><sd>only that she was Hitler's girlfriend.</sd><char dialog="Um-hm." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="What was it like having sex with Adolf Hitler? What do you wear in a" name="CHELSEA" /><sd>bunker? What did her parents think of Hitler as a potential son-in-law?

OK, I gotta relax. Phew. Wish me" name="KRAMER" /><sd>luck, huh?</sd><sd>Kramer gets up and approaches Fred Savage who's sitting at a table nearby.</sd><char dialog="Hey. Oh, did I frighten you? I'm not crazy. I mean, I may look" name="KRAMER" /><sd>weird, but I'm just like you, I'm just a regular guy just trying to make it in</sd><sd>this business.

Relax, relax." name="FRED" /><char dialog="Ok, but I got this..." name="KRAMER" /><sd>Kramer lifts his leg and places his foot on a low table and the table collapses.</sd><char dialog="Stupid table. You know, I'm not normally like this, usually I'm very" name="KRAMER" /><sd>cool and charming, I don't mean to bother you or anything but I think it's fate</sd><sd>that you happened to be here at the same time as me.</sd><char dialog="Yeah, its fate, you know, can't avoid your fate." name="FRED" /><char dialog="I got this treatment I think you'll be great in." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Yeah." name="FRED" /><char dialog="So I'd like to give it to you." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Yeah, thank you, thanks a lot. Bye!" name="FRED" /><char dialog="Alright, excuse me. Uh wait, wait." name="KRAMER" /><sd>Fred takes the treatment and bolts for the door.

'Cause I can't sleep all tucked in.</sd><char dialog="Oh, yes, yes." name="LUPE" /><char dialog="Yes, I like to just be able to take the blankets and swish them and" name="GEORGE" /><sd>swirl them, you know what I mean? You know, I don't like being all tucked in.</sd><sd>I like to have a lot of room, you know I like to have my toes pointed up in the</sd><sd>air. Just like to scrunch up the blankets.</sd><char dialog="Yes, yes. It's too tight to sleep." name="LUPE" /><char dialog="Exactly, you know what I'm talking about, right?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="It's too tight. (Gesturing towards Jerry) Him too?" name="LUPE" /><char dialog="Uh, Jerry, you want your blankets tucked in?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Excuse me, what?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="You want your blankets tucked in?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="What blankets?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="When Lupe makes up the beds in the morning." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I don't know, whatever they do." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I tuck in? Yes?" name="LUPE" /><char dialog="Tuck in, tuck in." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Alright, so that's one tuck and one no-tuck." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Okay." name="LUPE" /><char dialog="Yeah.

It's not Lupe's fault, you shouldn't have left it out." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Alright, just get your thing together and let's get out of here." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Alright, now. What mood am I in, what mood am I in?" name="GEORGE" /><sd>Cut to Jerry and George in the car, continuing their discussion.</sd><char dialog="You shouldn't have tucked." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I like it tucked." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Nobody tucks anymore." name="GEORGE" /><sd>As Jerry drives past, Kramer exits a printing shop, gets into his car and drives</sd><sd>off, spilling dozens of 8"x10" publicity photos. A police office notices this</sd><sd>and picks up one of the photos.</sd><sd>Another murder scene. A police officer pulls a blanket over the body's head,</sd><sd>but we catch a glimpse of the dead girl; it's Chelsea, Kramer's friend from the</sd><sd>auditions. The same two Lieutenants as before are just arriving.</sd><char dialog="Hey, Lieutenant." name="OFFICER" /><char dialog="Yeah." name="LT.

MARTEL" /><sd>patrol writing tickets to senior citizens with fake bus passes.</sd><char dialog="Yes sir." name="OFFICER" /><sd>The Lt. examines the evidence. It's a title page that says "The Keys" A movie</sd><sd>treatment by Kramer. The paper is torn so that the space where Kramer's first</sd><sd>name was is missing.</sd><char dialog="I think we just caught a break." name="LT. MARTEL" /><sd>Jerry and George are at the NBC studio.</sd><char dialog="This is very exciting! You're on the Tonight Show, NBC, who else is on" name="GEORGE" /><sd>the show?</sd><char dialog="I don't know." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Might meet a celebrity." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I can't believe she threw out my napkin." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="What are you worried about, you know it." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="You gonna be alright here?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah yeah yeah yeah, go. Go about your business, I'll just wander" name="GEORGE" /><sd>around.</sd><char dialog="Alright, don't wander too far, I'll meet you back here in fifteen" name="JERRY" /><sd>minutes.</sd><char dialog="Go, go, go, don't worry about it." name="GEORGE" /><sd>Jerry leaves and Corbin Bernsen enters through a stage door. he stands near</sd><sd>George, obviously waiting for someone.</sd><char dialog="Hey. (pointing at him) Corbin Bernsen." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="How ya doing?" name="CORBIN BERNSEN" /><char dialog="Big fan! Big fan." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Yeah." name="CORBIN BERNSEN" /><char dialog="Hey, you grew a beard, huh?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Yeah, yeah. I'm doing a movie during my hiatus." name="CORBIN BERNSEN" /><char dialog="Hey. You know, do I have a case for you guys to do on L.A. Law." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Really." name="CORBIN BERNSEN" /><sd>Flash forward to the middle of George's 'pitch'.</sd><char dialog="...so mind you, at this point I'm only going out with her two or three" name="GEORGE" /><sd>weeks. So she goes out of town and she asks me to feed her cat. So at this</sd><sd>time, there's a lot of stuff going on in my life and, uh, it slips my mind for a</sd><sd>few days. Maybe a week. Not a week, five, six days.</sd><char dialog="Yeah yeah yeah. So what happened?" name="CORBIN BERNSEN" /><char dialog="Well, it's the damnedest thing. The cat dies. So she comes back into" name="GEORGE" /><sd>town, she finds the cat lying on the carpet stiff as a board.</sd><char dialog="So you killed the cat." name="CORBIN BERNSEN" /><char dialog="That's what she says. I say, listen. It was an old cat. It died of" name="GEORGE" /><sd>natural causes. So get this, now she tells me that I gotta buy her a brand new</sd><sd>cat. I say listen, honey. First of all, it was a pretty old cat. I'm not</sd><sd>gonna buy you a brand new cat to replace an old dying cat. And second of all, I</sd><sd>go out to the garbage, I find you a new cat in fifteen seconds. I say, you show</sd><sd>me an autopsy report that says this cat died of starvation, I spring for a new</sd><sd>cat. So she says something to me, like, uh, I dunno, get the hell out of here,</sd><sd>and she breaks up with me. Now don't you think that would be a great case on</sd><sd>L.A. Law?</sd><sd>Corbin Bernsen just stares at George.</sd><sd>Flash forward, George is now talking with George Wendt in the same hallway.</sd><char dialog="I don't wanna tell you how to run your show." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Oh, of course not." name="GEORGE WENDT" /><char dialog="But really, it's enough with the bar already." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Yeah, well." name="GEORGE WENDT" /><char dialog="Seriously, have they though about changing the setting?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Doubt it, I doubt it. Yeah." name="GEORGE WENDT" /><char dialog="Really? Because people do meet in places besides a bar, huh?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Well yeah, they do, heh heh." name="GEORGE WENDT" /><char dialog="What about a rec room? Huh? Or a community center." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Yeah, you oughta write one of those." name="GEORGE WENDT" /><char dialog="Yeah?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Yeah, I'll bring it up with the producers, I gotta... uh..." name="GEORGE WENDT" /><char dialog="Fabulous, I'll think about that George, thank you!" name="GEORGE" /><sd>Jerry walks up as George Wendt leaves hastily.</sd><char dialog="How's it going?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Great! Great! I actually just had two meaningful intelligent" name="GEORGE" /><sd>conversations with Corbin Bernsen and George Wendt.</sd><char dialog="Really?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah, not fan talk, not gushing, you know? Actual conversation, I was" name="GEORGE" /><sd>incredibly articulate!</sd><char dialog="You got toilet paper on your heel there." name="JERRY" /><sd>George looks down, Jerry walks away.</sd><sd>The Tonight Show, George is in the audience applauding.</sd><char dialog="It's the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. Tonight Jay welcomes Corbin" name="ANNOUNCER" /><sd>Bernsen, George Wendt and comedian Jerry Seinfeld.</sd><sd>Quick cut to Corbin Bernsen, mid-interview.</sd><char dialog="Oh yeah, yeah, people are always coming up to me trying to give" name="CORBIN BERNSEN" /><sd>me a great case for L.A. Law, just a few seconds ago, right here, right outside</sd><sd>in the hallway this nut, some sick nut comes up to me and says he's supposed to</sd><sd>watch this girl's cat while she's away out of town. Anyway he forgets to feed</sd><sd>the cat, the cat dies, starves to death, he kills the cat, refuses to get her a</sd><sd>new one, won't give her any money, won't pay her, and he wants Arnie Becker to</sd><sd>represent him.
