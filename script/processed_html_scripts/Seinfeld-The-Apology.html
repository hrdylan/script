I have never had living-room naked." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Oh, it's a scene." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="It's like you're livin' in the Playboy Mansion! Did she, uh, did she frolic?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I don't really have enough room." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah. Hey, Lainie, Puddy." name="GEORGE," /><char dialog="Hey!" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Hi." name="PUDDY" /><char dialog="Hey." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I got to make a pit stop." name="PUDDY," /><char dialog="'Kay." name="ELAINE," /><char dialog="Back together?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="His apartment was being fumigated, so we thought we'd give it another shot." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Ah..." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="So guess who called me last night? Jason Hanke." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="'Stanky Hanke'? What did he want?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="He called to apologize for standing me up five years ago." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Why now?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="A.A. It's one of the Twelve Steps. Step number Nine is you have to" name="ELAINE" /><sd>apologize to anyone you've ever wronged.</sd><char dialog="Ho ho ho ho! I can't wait for Hanke to come crawling back to me." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Still with the neck hole?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Still upset. Very upset." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="What neck hole?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Remember that New Year's party he threw a few years ago? He had that" name="GEORGE" /><sd>very drafty apartment, you know, I think on Ninth Avenue.</sd><char dialog="I asked if I could borrow a sweater." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="A cashmere sweater." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I said preferably cashmere, for warmth. So in front of the whole" name="GEORGE" /><sd>party, he says, 'No. I don't want you stretching out the neck hole.'</sd><char dialog="Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Oh, yeah, sure, laugh it up. Everybody else did!" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Well, it's funny. I mean, you have a big head. Or is it 'cause of" name="ELAINE" /><sd>your neck?</sd><char dialog="No, I think the head does most of the stretching." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Regardless. I had to walk around for the rest of the party in some" name="GEORGE" /><sd>cheap Metlife windbreaker. Now, it is payback time.</sd><char dialog="I really think it's the size of your neck." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="It's my head!" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Hey." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Hey." name="PEGGY" /><char dialog="Isn't this great? With those nerds in accounting moved, you and I" name="ELAINE" /><sd>are the only ones who use this bathroom. (Elaine is surprised to see Peggy get a seat protector for the toilet)</sd><char dialog="You went to the coffee shop without me? I told ya, I just wanted to" name="KRAMER" /><sd>hop in the shower.</sd><char dialog="That was an hour ago. What were you doing in there?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Showering. How long does it take you?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Ten minutes." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Ten minutes? That's kooky talk. Hey Elaine, how long do you spend in the shower?" name="KRAMER," /><char dialog="Ten minutes." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Let me smell you." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="All right. Whiff away." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Uh... that's not bad at all." name="KRAMER," /><char dialog="Hup! That's it." name="ELAINE," /><char dialog="" name="KRAMER," /><char dialog="" name="OK." /><char dialog="So get this. I'm in the bathroom at work today, and I see Peggy" name="ELAINE" /><sd>using a seat protector.</sd><char dialog="So?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="So... we're the only women on the floor. I mean, we're like" name="ELAINE" /><sd>roommates. Would-would you use a seat protector if you had a roommate?</sd><char dialog="" name="JERRY," /><char dialog="think the damage is probably already done." name="I" /><char dialog="All right! I'll get that. Well, maybe she just practices good hygiene." name="JERRY," /><char dialog="Yeah, you're probably right. She's probably one of those neurotic clean freaks." name="ELAINE," /><char dialog="Mmm." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Well, here's my shower routine. Maybe I can make some changes. Get" name="KRAMER" /><sd>wash cloth mittens and maybe some liquid soap, and just... -pop- focus!</sd><char dialog="Zephyr? That is not a word." name="JERRY," /><char dialog="Do you challenge?" name="MELISSA" /><char dialog="No, I do not challenge." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="66 points. Ha ha." name="MELISSA" /><char dialog="I'd accuse you of cheating, but I don't know where you'd hide the" name="JERRY" /><sd>tiles.</sd><char dialog="You want some more ice tea?" name="MELISSA" /><char dialog="Sure." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Wrong pipe." name="MELISSA," /><char dialog="So she coughed." name="GEORGE," /><char dialog="Coughing... naked... It's a turn-off, man." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Everything goes with naked." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="When you cough, there are thousands of unseen muscles that suddenly" name="JERRY" /><sd>spring into action. It's like watching that fat guy catch a cannonball in his</sd><sd>stomach in slow motion.</sd><char dialog="Oh, you spoiled, spoiled man. Do you now how much mental energy I" name="GEORGE" /><sd>expend just trying to picture women naked?</sd><char dialog="But the thing you don't realize is that there's good naked and bad" name="JERRY" /><sd>naked. Naked hair brushing, good; naked crouching, bad. Hey, there's Hanke.</sd><char dialog="All right. It's grovel time." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Hey, George. Jerry. Listen, I just got sober, so I've been going" name="HANKE" /><sd>through the Twelve Steps.</sd><char dialog="What are you up to now, uh, Step Nine?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Yeah. Making amends." name="HANKE" /><char dialog="Important step. Maybe the most important." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Anyway, uh, Jerry, you know, this may sound dumb, but, you know, when" name="HANKE" /><sd>we first met I thought your name was Gary. And, I think I may even have</sd><sd>called you Gary a couple of times, and... I don't know if you noticed, but I</sd><sd>always felt bad about it, so, I'm sorry.</sd><char dialog="Thank you. I did notice, and I appreciate you rectifying it." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="(eyeing George, who's looking expectedly up at him): Great. Great." name="HANKE" /><sd>Well, I'll see you guys later.</sd><char dialog="Well, I just got out of a 27-minute" name="KRAMER," /><sd>shower. I made some good cuts, and I didn't lose anything I needed. Yeah, I</sd><sd>think what I kept is even stronger now.</sd><char dialog="You got some suds over here." name="JERRY," /><char dialog="Wha...? Oh, man! Geez! Look at that! I'm all lathery. Jerry, you got to show me what I'm doing" name="KRAMER," /><sd>wrong.</sd><char dialog="Oh, come on!" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No, I mean it, man. I'm lost!" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="You promise you'll never come in here again?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Oh, Jerry, you know I can't do that." name="KRAMER," /><char dialog="Now my sense of it is that you're probably" name="JERRY," /><sd>wasting time working piecemeal, first cleaning one area, then another.</sd><char dialog="Well, that's how cats do it." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="But, when you have a faucet instead of a tongue, you want to use" name="JERRY" /><sd>gravity.</sd><char dialog="OK. Let's turn the water on now." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="No, I told you, it's just a dry run." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Well, Hanke's moved on to Step Ten. He" name="GEORGE," /><sd>was spotted taking personal inventory.</sd><char dialog="That's Step Ten?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="All he has to do now is count his blessings, say a prayer, and he's" name="GEORGE" /><sd>done. Do you believe this?</sd><char dialog="Come on, Jerry. How about a-a baggy swimsuit?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="You're not gettin' any skin, Kramer." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Well, this has all been one big tease!" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="These proofs look pretty good. Oh. Can I move this? Yup. I think this will work." name="ELAINE," /><char dialog="I'm... gonna get another bottle of water." name="PEGGY," /><char dialog="Here, take mine. There's a little left." name="WALTER," /><char dialog="Oh, thanks, Walter. Ahh!" name="PEGGY," /><char dialog="Guys, there's no doubt that the pay" name="HANKE," /><sd>is good. But I don't just know if I see myself working with ice cream.</sd><char dialog="You get pretty buff forearms." name="MAN #1" /><char dialog="I don't know if I'm into that." name="HANKE" /><char dialog="Oh, hello, Hanke, others." name="GEORGE," /><char dialog="George." name="HANKE" /><char dialog="You know, Jason, I, uh, I couldn't help notice, I... I didn't get my" name="GEORGE" /><sd>apology.</sd><char dialog="Apology? For what?" name="HANKE" /><char dialog="A drafty apartment? A... sweaterless friend? A ball-game giveaway" name="GEORGE" /><sd>Metlife windbreaker?</sd><char dialog="George, come on, not that neck hole thing." name="HANKE" /><char dialog="Yeah, the neck hole thing, and I would appreciate it if you would" name="GEORGE" /><sd>say you're sorry.</sd><char dialog="No way, you would've completely stretched it out." name="HANKE" /><char dialog="You're an alcoholic! You have to apologize. Step Nine! Step Nine." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="All right, George, all right. I'm sorry. I'm very, very sorry. I'm so" name="HANKE" /><sd>sorry that I didn't want your rather bulbous head struggling to find its way</sd><sd>through the normal-size neck hole of my finely knit sweater.</sd><char dialog="Now see, that's smart. Constant motion. Wow." name="KRAMER," /><char dialog="Hey!" name="MAN IN SHOWER," /><char dialog="Oh, yeah, yeah, I-I'm watching you, too. But this guy's really" name="KRAMER" /><sd>showing me something!</sd><char dialog="You got a steak?" name="KRAMER," /><char dialog="What happened to you?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Ah, people in this city are crazy." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Here ya go." name="JERRY," /><char dialog="Thanks, buddy. Oh... yes! Hey, you" name="KRAMER," /><sd>got any A1, 'cause I'm cooking a steak.</sd><char dialog="What?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah, a different one." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Oh!" name="JERRY," /><char dialog="Jerry!" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="OK, Jerry. I fixed that bike." name="MELISSA," /><char dialog="Oh. That wasn't really necessary. I don't ride it. It's just for" name="JERRY" /><sd>show.</sd><char dialog="I should really clean those bearings. Hold this. Look at all that gunk." name="MELISSA," /><char dialog="Please don't crouch." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Ouch! Caught my skin." name="MELISSA" /><char dialog="Oh, that's bad. Especially that area." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="You got anything to snack on?" name="MELISSA" /><char dialog="Uhh..." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Oh, pickles! Unnhhhh! It's a tough one." name="MELISSA," /><char dialog="Look, please stop! Let me help you with that!" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Unnnnh! Oooh. That's gonna leave a welt." name="MELISSA," /><sd>Look at that.</sd><char dialog="I can't. I can't look anymore. I-I-I've seen too" name="JERRY," /><sd>much.</sd><char dialog="Peggy, we've got to talk. What is it about me that you find so" name="ELAINE" /><sd>offensive?</sd><char dialog="You seem to be with a lot of men." name="PEGGY" /><char dialog="What!? I happen to have a very steady boyfriend. You know, I mean," name="ELAINE" /><sd>we broke up a few times and there has been an occasional guy here or... or</sd><sd>there, but, wh-why is this your business?</sd><char dialog="It's not. Good day. Elaine, (leaving the room after rubbing Peggy's keyboard on her butt," name="PEGGY" /><sd>right. You think I've got germs? I'll give you some germs. How about some for</sd><sd>your keyboard, huh? Huh? Oooh, how about for your stapler. Hmmm? That's good,</sd><sd>isn't it? You have a happy and a healthy.</sd><char dialog="Well, technically he did apologize." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Jerry, I felt like a straight man in some horrible sketch. He was" name="GEORGE" /><sd>riffing! Riffing! On my pain!</sd><char dialog="So now you want an apology for the apology, plus the original" name="JERRY" /><sd>apology?</sd><char dialog="That's right. I'm two in the hole!" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Well, I hit the wall yesterday with Lady Godiva. She did a full body" name="JERRY" /><sd>flex on a pickle jar.</sd><char dialog="Did you explain to her about the good naked and the bad naked?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Where am I gonna get a fat guy and a cannonball?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Well... what if you showed up bad naked, huh? You still got that" name="GEORGE" /><sd>belt sander?</sd><char dialog="Yeah." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Well, you on all fours, that thing" name="GEORGE," /><sd>vibratin', kickin' up sawdust, ho ho! She'll get the picture!</sd><char dialog="Hello?" name="JERRY," /><char dialog="Hey, Jerry, guess where I'm calling from!" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="World War I plane?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No, I'm in my shower. Well, you know, I'm trying to get out of the" name="KRAMER" /><sd>shower sooner, and then I ask myself, 'Why?' I mean this is where I want to</sd><sd>be. So I got a waterproof phone, I shaved, I brushed my teeth, and now I</sd><sd>ordered a pair of chinos from J. Crew.</sd><char dialog="When are ya gettin' out?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I'm not! I'll see ya later, buddy." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Bad news, people. Peggy is home sick." name="PETERMAN" /><char dialog="Oh, please." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="She's stuffed up, achy, and suffering from intense malaise." name="PETERMAN" /><char dialog="Oh, come on, we all have intense malaise. Right?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="I just spoke with her, Elaine. She's in bed." name="PETERMAN" /><char dialog="Yeah, let me tell you something: this is all in her mind, OK? She is" name="ELAINE" /><sd>insane. She thinks I made her sick because I coughed on her doorknob, rubbed</sd><sd>her stapler in my armpit, and put her keyboard on my butt. Yeah, she's a</sd><sd>wacko.</sd><char dialog="So you're Jason Hanke's supervisor?" name="GEORGE," /><char dialog="Sponsor." name="SPONSOR" /><char dialog="Whatever. Listen, I'm very concerned about this guy." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="He's doing very well. He's already on to Step Ten." name="SPONSOR" /><char dialog="Yeah, well when you don't actually do the steps, you can go through" name="GEORGE" /><sd>them pretty quick. You can get through six a day.</sd><char dialog="Is there some unresolved issue between you and Jason?" name="SPONSOR" /><char dialog="I don't know. A little thing called Step Nine? Instead of an" name="GEORGE" /><sd>apology, he was beboppin' and scattin' all over me.</sd><char dialog="I'm not sure what you want me to do." name="SPONSOR" /><char dialog="Well, aren't you the boss of him? You shouldn't let him move up!" name="GEORGE" /><sd>When I was in the Cub Scouts, I got stuck on Weebolos for three years 'cause</sd><sd>I kept losing the Pinewood Derby.</sd><char dialog="You're quite upset, George." name="SPONSOR" /><char dialog="Well, I think you should drop him down to Step Two." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Admit there's a higher power?" name="SPONSOR" /><char dialog="Yeah, let him chew on that for a while." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="You know George, I think I can help you. We're having a meeting" name="SPONER" /><sd>tomorrow. Why don't you just come by?</sd><char dialog="All right. That's more like it. Thank you very much." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="By the way, my uncle was an alcoholic, so..." name="GEORGE," /><char dialog="Lomez, you're not listenin'. Jerry" name="KRAMER," /><sd>likes the naked, just some of the things she does when she's naked. Calm</sd><sd>down, I'm on your side. Geez. Hey, hold on a second. I got a clog, I'll call</sd><sd>ya back.</sd><char dialog="What are you doing?" name="MELISSA," /><char dialog="I found a rough spot on the kitchen" name="JERRY," /><sd>floor, I thought I'd polish it up with this belt sander I have here.</sd><char dialog="No, not that. Why are you naked?" name="MELISSA" /><char dialog="I thought naked is good." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="This isn't good naked." name="MELISSA," /><char dialog="George, here, have a seat." name="SPONSOR," /><char dialog="Where's Hanke?" name="GEORGE," /><char dialog="Shhhhh." name="SPONSOR," /><char dialog="OK, let's get started. Welcome to Rage-aholics Anonymous." name="LEADER" /><char dialog="What? Rate-aholics?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="George, this can help you." name="SPONSOR" /><char dialog="Hey, I am not here for rage. I'm here for revenge." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Excuse me. We have a 'no yelling' policy at these meetings." name="LEADER" /><char dialog="Excuse me. Am I talking to you, Pinhead? Am I?!" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Please don't call me 'Pinhead'." name="LEADER" /><char dialog="I'm losin' it!" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="He took you to Rage-aholics? Why?" name="JERRY," /><char dialog="Probably because this whole Universe is against me!" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="You've got a little rage." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I know. And now they want me to bottle it up. It makes me so mad!" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="By the way, my bad naked demo didn't quite work." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="This bread has nuts in it!" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Oh, great. Elaine. What is wrong with" name="JERRY," /><sd>my body?</sd><char dialog="Chicken wing shoulder blades." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="That's it?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No, but that's one problem. Why?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Well, I was walking around naked in front of Melissa the other day--" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Whoa! Walking around naked? Ahh... that is not a good look for a" name="ELAINE" /><sd>man.</sd><char dialog="Why not? It's a good look for a woman." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Well, the female body is a... work of art. The male body is" name="ELAINE" /><sd>utilitarian, it's for gettin' around, like a jeep.</sd><char dialog="So you don't think it's attractive?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="It's hideous. The hair, the... the lumpiness. It's simian." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Well, some women like it." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Hmm. Sickies." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Installing your Clarkman garbage disposal. Dismantle latch hasp beneath main drainage lot." name="KRAMER," /><sd>Oh, come on, Clarkman.</sd><char dialog="Puddy." name="PUDDY," /><char dialog="Is, uh, David Puddy there?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="This is Puddy." name="PUDDY" /><char dialog="Well, this is Kramer." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="I know." name="PUDDY" /><char dialog="Um, listen, you're a mechanic. Could you help me install a garbage" name="KRAMER" /><sd>disposal?</sd><char dialog="Well, it's a big job. You've got to dismantle the latch hasp from the" name="PUDDY" /><sd>auxiliary drainage line.</sd><char dialog="No. It says 'main line'." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="It's a misprint. What do you got, a Clarkman?" name="PUDDY" /><char dialog="Yeah. through it." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Oh, OK. Well, thanks, buddy." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Hey, Puddy." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Hey, Babe, your boss called. You owe five bucks for a balloon" name="PUDDY" /><sd>bouquet. Yeah, he says you can just give it to him tomorrow when you see him.</sd><char dialog="Balloon bouquet? For who?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Peggy took a turn for the worst." name="PUDDY" /><char dialog="Peggy. Oh, great. I suppose she's still blaming me?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="That's what he said." name="PUDDY" /><char dialog="I don't believe this woman." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Talk to me, Babe." name="PUDDY" /><char dialog="She's this crazy woman who is convinced that my germs make her sick." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Oh, germ-o-phobe. I know what that's about." name="PUDDY" /><char dialog="Huh?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="What is this symbol?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="It's a germ." name="PUDDY" /><char dialog="Elaine, it was very nice of you to bring the man you're currently" name="PEGGY" /><sd>sleeping with over to talk to me, but I assure you, I don't have any problem</sd><sd>with germs.</sd><char dialog="Don't you? Elaine. (Elaine slowly creeps up towards Peggy)" name="PUDDY" /><char dialog="I know it looks bleak. I've been there. Ten years ago waking up in" name="PUDDY" /><sd>bed next to a woman like this would've sent me running for the Phisohex.</sd><char dialog="Really?" name="PEGGY" /><char dialog="I still have trouble looking at those disgusting old bedroom slippers" name="PUDDY" /><sd>she slogs around in.</sd><char dialog="Hey, I've had those since college. They're bunnies." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="They're bacteria traps." name="PUDDY" /><char dialog="So you... just learned to live with it?" name="PEGGY" /><char dialog="For the most part." name="PUDDY" /><char dialog="OK, we're broken up for the rest of the day." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="So I'm glad we had a talk and worked this out. Don't you feel this is" name="JERRY" /><sd>better?</sd><char dialog="This is nice." name="MELISSA" /><char dialog="Yes, clothes. This is normal." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Hey, what are you doing tomorrow? I was thinking that we could go" name="MELISSA" /><sd>down...

(Kramer uses his shower garbage disposal to unclog the tub)" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="So what are you up to?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Oh, just cooking up a little thank you for Puddy. Hey, how do you" name="KRAMER" /><sd>make those radish roses?</sd><char dialog="Insert a knife into the center and twist. Then, to make it bloom," name="JERRY" /><sd>soak it in water for thirty to forty minutes.</sd><char dialog="No problem there." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="George. Thanks for coming down to talk" name="HANKE," /><sd>to me. I wanted to see you right away, but my hours here aren't very</sd><sd>flexible. I just started yesterday.</sd><char dialog="Well, I'm here. What is it?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Well, I talked to my sponsor, and, uh, I've thought it over, and, you" name="HANKE" /><sd>know, my apology at the coffee shop was sarcastic, and rude, and you deserve</sd><sd>much better.</sd><char dialog="You're welcome." name="HANKE" /><char dialog="Can I get a Triple Minute Man Mint?" name="KID," /><char dialog="Waffle or sugar cone?" name="HANKE" /><char dialog="Uh, excuse me, uh, um, Jason.

George, what are you talking" name="HANKE" /><sd>about?</sd><char dialog="Well, it's just, all you said was 'your welcome', which is nice." name="GEORGE" /><sd>It's very nice. But... I feel I gotta get the apology.</sd><char dialog="Is there anybody else here but you?" name="KID" /><char dialog="I'm alone, and it's my second day. You know, I don't even think we" name="HANKE" /><sd>have that flavor so... George, really, enough, ok? You know, I-I admitted I</sd><sd>was wrong, so what more do you want from me?</sd><char dialog="I would like an apology." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="All right, look, you know--" name="HANKE" /><char dialog="Did you try it?" name="KID #2," /><char dialog="No, this guy doesn't know what he's doing." name="KID" /><char dialog="Oh, yes I do.

Now say it" name="GEORGE" /><sd>again, and tell it to me.</sd><char dialog="I'm not saying anything to you. I'm not sorry. I was never sorry. It" name="HANKE" /><sd>was cashmere. I hate Step Nine!
