Well, I've been waiting out two or three marriages, but this is the one I really had my eye on." name="ELAINE" /><set>(George enters, somewhat annoyed.

So.. (Goes for his coat)" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="(Fixing up his pants) Yeah.. look at this, Mickey.

She's the worst driver." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="You know what? On my first road test, I hit a dog. (Jerry nods, blinking) I think it was a golden retriever. No, no, no, it was a - it was a yellow lab. (Picks" name="ELAINE" /><sd>up the car phone) I'm gonna check my messages. (Begins to dial as she pulls up to a pedestrian crosswalk.

I'm calling Beth tonight, and if you want a clean shot at David, I suggest you do likewise." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="(Nodding) Yeah, yeah.." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="But we gotta make it seem like we're not calling for dates." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Then why are we calling?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Good question. (More to himself than to Elaine) Why are we calling?" name="JERRY" /><set>(Both start chanting "why are we calling..", thinking deeply)</set><char dialog="(Loud) Oh!

(Realizes) Well, you don't think it had anything to do with what I said, do you?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="What'd you say?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="You know, that, that thing about her being too good for him. I mean, I was just bein' folksy. They could tell I was just being folksy..?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Yeah, I thought you were being folksy." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Totally folksy." name="GEORGE" /><sd>(Kramer enters wearing a new pair of jeans. They're obviously way too small. Unable to bend his knees, he walks awkwardly into the room. Elaine, Jerry, and</sd><sd>George are speechless - staring at him. Kramer walks past them, and attempts to pick a magazine off the table, but does so with great difficulty. Jerry starts to laugh</sd><sd>as Kramer throws the magazine back down)</sd><char dialog="hey, uh..

(Brief pause) So, have you told many.. people yet?" name="JERRY" /><set>(Scene jumps back to Elaine)</set><char dialog="Because it's really nobody's business." name="ELAINE" /><set>(Back to Jerry)</set><char dialog="Anyway, I just called to tell you that, I'm there for you." name="JERRY" /><set>(Cut back to Elaine)</set><char dialog="&quot;There&quot; is, um.. anywhere you want me to be.." name="ELAINE" /><set>(Back to Jerry)</set><char dialog="Sure, dinner would be fine." name="JERRY" /><set>(Back to Elaine)</set><char dialog="And I could just be there.
