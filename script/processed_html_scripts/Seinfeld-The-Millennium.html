I can't get fired." name="GEORGE" /><sd>A passing fan spots him.</sd><char dialog="Hey, body-suit man. 's up?" name="FAN" /><sd>He slaps palms with George, who doesn't look especially pleased by the</sd><sd>attention. The fan points out George to more fans.</sd><char dialog="(pointing) Hey, body-suit man." name="FAN" /><sd>The fans gather round, making positive noises. George looks resigned to his</sd><sd>minor celebrity.</sd><set>(Putumayo)</set><sd>Gladys is behind the counter. Outside the door, Elaine peers in for a second</sd><sd>before she moves back out of sight. Then, a be-suited Kramer is pushed into</sd><sd>sight. He enters the store, smoking a cigar.</sd><char dialog="Hi, I'm H.E. Pennypacker. I'm a wealthy American industrialist uh," name="KRAMER" /><sd>looking to open a silver mine in the mountains of Peru and uh, before I invest</sd><sd>millions in a lucrative mine, I, I'd like to go a little native.

Are these free?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Yeah." name="GLADYS" /><char dialog="Hmm-mmm." name="KRAMER" /><sd>Kramer strolls over to a rack and grabs a selection of a half-dozen items. He</sd><sd>then heads for the changing room.</sd><char dialog="Some of those are women's clothes." name="GLADYS" /><char dialog="Oh, not a problem." name="KRAMER" /><sd>He pulls the curtain shut. The sound of a pricing gun can be heard. The clicking</sd><sd>goes on for a couple of seconds, and then the gun is dropped. It lands by</sd><sd>Kramer's feet and breaks, Kramer then exacerbates his problem by kicking the gun</sd><sd>as he tries to retrieve it.</sd><set>(Yankee's Parking Lot)</set><sd>George is driving his car in a circle in the parking lot. Trailing behind the</sd><sd>car, on a rope, is a trophy which bounces and clatters on the tarmac. George is</sd><sd>leaning out of the car window, with a megaphone.</sd><char dialog="Attention Steinbrenner and front-office morons! Your triumphs mean" name="GEORGE" /><sd>nothing. You all stink. You can sit on it, and rotate! This is George Costanza.</sd><sd>I fear no reprisal. Extension five-one-seven-oh.</sd><set>(Putumayo)</set><sd>Gladys is still behind the counter. Valerie and Mrs Hamilton are browsing the</sd><sd>racks. Elaine enters and, holding her hand up to hide her face, she walks over</sd><sd>to the changing room, pulls back the curtain and enters.</sd><char dialog="L'Occupado." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Come on, what is taking you so long?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Elaine, I broke the price-gun, so I had to move to plan B." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Plan B? There is no plan B." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="(holds up some small white sachets) I took these out of every single" name="KRAMER" /><sd>garment in the store.</sd><char dialog="What?!" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="They're dessicates.

Forget it!" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="What?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="You have screwed me again, Pennypacker!" name="ELAINE" /><sd>Elaine leaves, hurrying through the store with her face shielded again.</sd><char dialog="Ladies, care for some chips?" name="GLADYS" /><char dialog="(emerging from the changing room) Well, I don't mind if I do." name="KRAMER" /><sd>He takes a chip and dips it. As he loads the chip with the dip, a sachet of</sd><sd>dessicate falls from his sleeve into the dip. He doesn't notice, and after</sd><sd>consuming the chip he deposits the bundle of clothing onto the counter.</sd><char dialog="Well, I've uh, I've changed my mind. I think I'm going to build a" name="KRAMER" /><sd>rollercoaster instead.</sd><sd>Kramer leaves. Mrs Hamilton comes over to the counter, takes a chip, dips it</sd><sd>into the dessicate-laced dip and eats it.</sd><set>(Steinbrenner's Office)</set><sd>George stands before Steinbrenner's desk, in his shirt-sleeves, nonchalantly</sd><sd>eating something. He occasionally shrugs at Steinbrenner's remarks.</sd><char dialog="I heard what you did in the parking lot, big boy, and it is" name="STEINBRENNER" /><sd>in-excuse-a-bull. You personally insulted me, my staff... I cannot believe that</sd><sd>you, body-suit man, could perpetrate such a disloyalty. Breaks my heart to say</sd><sd>it... Oh, who am I kidding? I love it. You're fi...</sd><sd>George looks expectant, as Steinbrenner reaches this point. Suddenly, Mr Wilhelm</sd><sd>enters the office.</sd><char dialog="Wait, wait, Mr Steinbrenner. George doesn't deserve any of the blame" name="WILHELM" /><sd>for what happened in the parking lot today, sir. If there's anyone to blame</sd><sd>here, it's me.</sd><sd>George stares at Wilhelm in disbelief.</sd><char dialog="What're you talking about, Wilhelm. You popping pills? You got the" name="STEINBRENNER" /><sd>crazies again?</sd><char dialog="No, no. No, no, sir. I ordered George to drive around insulting people" name="WILHELM" /><sd>today. Because I'm tired of all your macho head games.</sd><char dialog="(agitated) He's lying, sir! I'm tired of all your macho head games!" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Macho head games?" name="STEINBRENNER" /><char dialog="(puts arm round George's shoulder) He's just being loyal to me, sir." name="WILHELM" /><char dialog="Wilhelm, you're fired.

(rising) Now, if you gentlemen'll excuse me, I'm not going to the game</sd><sd>today, I'm gonna go outside and scalp some tickets.

George, you are looking at the new head scout of" name="WILHELM" /><sd>the New York Mets.</sd><sd>Wilhelm walks away toward the door, leaving George looking crushed.</sd><char dialog="(singing) Meet the Mets, meet the Mets. Come right out and greet the" name="WILHELM" /><sd>Mets.</sd><set>(Jerry's Apartment)</set><char dialog="I don't know what Elaine is so upset about. I mean, without dessicates," name="KRAMER" /><sd>those clothes'll be noticeably musty in five years.</sd><char dialog="She never sees the big picture." name="JERRY" /><sd>There's a knock at the door. Jerry opens it to reveal Newman.</sd><char dialog="Hello, Newman!" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Hello Jerry. (to Kramer) What did you say to Elaine? I just got her" name="NEWMAN" /><sd>cancellation in the mail.</sd><char dialog="Oh, well I guess she found some place better to go." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Well, it's her mistake. Because she is going to miss the party of a" name="NEWMAN" /><sd>lifetime.</sd><char dialog="Well, maybe so, but come midnight, when she's looking for someone warm" name="KRAMER" /><sd>and cuddly to kiss, I guess you'll be caught between the moon and New York City.</sd><char dialog="Alright. Come back to my party, please." name="NEWMAN" /><char dialog="Jerry too, of course." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="(reluctant) You don't wanna do your... act, or anything, do you?" name="NEWMAN" /><char dialog="No." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Alright then, I guess I can accept a little Jerry, if it gets me a" name="NEWMAN" /><sd>(suggestive) lot of Elaine.</sd><sd>Jerry pulls a disgusted face.</sd><char dialog="Deal?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="To the Newmanniun! (holds out his hand)" name="NEWMAN" /><char dialog="(grasps Newman's hand) To the Kramennium." name="KRAMER" /><sd>Kramer and Newman move to the door to leave. Newman stops as Jerry speaks to</sd><sd>him, and Kramer exits to his apartment.</sd><char dialog="By the way Newman, I'm just curious. When you booked the hotel, did you" name="JERRY" /><sd>book it for the millennium New Year?</sd><char dialog="(smug) As a matter of fact, I did." name="NEWMAN" /><char dialog="Oh, that's interesting, because as everyone knows, since there was no" name="JERRY" /><sd>year zero, the millennium doesn't begin until the year two-thousand and one.</sd><sd>Which would make your party, one year late, and thus, quite lame.</sd><sd>Newman absorbs the logic of Jerry's argument. His face twitches as he realises</sd><sd>his error.</sd><char dialog="Aww!" name="JERRY" /><sd>Newman makes a noise redolent of his frustration - a sort of half-strangulated</sd><sd>nasal squeak. He then waddles away after Kramer.</sd><set>(Mrs Hamilton's Apartment)</set><sd>Valerie and Mrs Hamilton sit on the couch. Mrs Hamilton looks nauseous.</sd><char dialog="I don't feel well at all.
