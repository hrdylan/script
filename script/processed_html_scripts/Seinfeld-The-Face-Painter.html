Aren't you a part of" name="KRAMER" /><sd>society? Because if you don't want to be a part of society, Jerry, why don't</sd><sd>you just get in your car and move to the East Side!</sd><char dialog="Look, we got five hours before the game. I am betting it was a funeral" name="JERRY" /><sd>'hello'.

You made this?" name="PUDDY" /><char dialog="No, it's from the store." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Oh. Hey, how come people don't have dip for dinner? Why is it only a" name="PUDDY" /><sd>snack, why can't it be a meal, you know? I don't understand stuff like that.</sd><char dialog="David?

I apologize.</sd><sd>Even though, Barry, between me and you, we both know that you started it. I</sd><sd>mean, who's kidding who?

So no hard feelings?</sd><sd>Kramer moves in for a handshake, Barry spits water all over his jacket.
