Like, remember when you were in school, and teachers would get all riled up if they caught you with gum? And when you were a kid, you'd think 'What is the big deal?' But, as an adult, I can understand it, because when you're chewing gum, you don't look like you're too thrilled with anything anyone has to say. (as sarcastic teen) 'Oh, World War Two.

The lenses are much stronger than the first pair - they're</sd><sd>like bottle-bottoms. He stares through them, his eyes magnified hugely. It's</sd><sd>obvious he can't see at all clearly.</sd><char dialog="Aw, these are really strong glasses." name="JERRY" /><sd>He takes a step and almost trips over the counter.</sd><char dialog="Hey gum-buddy. Nice frames. You ready to go?" name="LLOYD" /><char dialog="(lacking enthusiasm) Yeah, yeah." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="(clapping Jerry on the back) Oh yeah, he's all ready to go." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Anybody see Elaine today?" name="LLOYD" /><char dialog="Oh yeah, she called a little earlier.

Or not wearing," name="LLOYD" /><sd>if you know what I mean.</sd><sd>They chuckle.</sd><char dialog="Absolutely. Let's just stick around." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Ah, tell you what, they're expecting us though. Lemme just grab a hotdog" name="LLOYD" /><sd>here.</sd><char dialog="Uh, yeah." name="KRAMER" /><sd>Lloyd goes to the counter, and speaks to the attendant.</sd><char dialog="I'd like a hotdog, please." name="LLOYD" /><sd>The attendant looks to the machine, which contains one hotdog. The appearance of</sd><sd>the article is not pleasant. It's wrinkled, shriveled, and generally</sd><sd>disgusting.</sd><char dialog="Are you outta your mind?" name="ATTENDANT" /><sd>Hearing this, Kramer dashes over.</sd><char dialog="Wh...wh...wh... what's the problem here?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="This hotdog's been here since the silent era. You'd have to be insane" name="ATTENDANT" /><sd>to eat it.</sd><char dialog="No, no, no, no, no. This man is not insane. Now there's nothing wrong" name="KRAMER" /><sd>with it or you.</sd><char dialog="Kramer, maybe..." name="LLOYD" /><char dialog="No, no, no, no. I'll show you. (slams a bill down on the counter) One" name="KRAMER" /><sd>hotdog please.</sd><char dialog="(on your head be it) Okay." name="ATTENDANT" /><char dialog="Mmm, doesn't that smell good, huh?" name="KRAMER" /><sd>The attendant hands over the hotdog.</sd><char dialog="Yeah, here we go, yeah. (he takes a big bite) Mmm, oh. That's delicious." name="KRAMER" /><sd>Mmm. It's a perfectly sane food to eat. (he takes another bite)</sd><sd>As he chews, it begins to be apparent that all is not as it should be with the</sd><sd>hotdog.</sd><char dialog="Uhm, interesting texture. It's chewy. (he half-coughs, half-retches) I" name="KRAMER" /><sd>gotta get, some air.</sd><sd>Kramer stumbles toward the exit, bits of half-chewed hotdog falling from his</sd><sd>mouth.</sd><set>(Street Outside Alex)</set><sd>Kramer walks stiffly along the sidewalk. He's breathing heavily, and loosening</sd><sd>his collar. He walks by the florist, who is brushing the sidewalk again. As</sd><sd>Kramer passes George's car, his struggle with the rancid hotdog ends with the</sd><sd>hotdog triumphant, and he leans into the gutter behind the Le Baron and vomits</sd><sd>copiously. The florist looks rueful, leans his broom against his door, and</sd><sd>fetches his hose, whilst Kramer continues his refunding.</sd><sd>Later)</sd><sd>The florist is hosing away the traces of Kramer's visit. Elaine walks up to him.</sd><char dialog="Excuse me. 'scuse me, weren't you told to stop using that hose?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="How would you happen to know that?" name="FLORIST" /><char dialog="Well, uhm... I..." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="(accusing) You're that lady that was talking to the cops, aren't you?" name="FLORIST" /><char dialog="Uh... I..." name="ELAINE" /><sd>A voice calls from across the street.</sd><char dialog="Hey, Joe!" name="VOICE" /><sd>The florist turns to see who's shouting. As he does, he raises the nozzle of his</sd><sd>hose, so instead of hosing the sidewalk, he sprays Elaine.</sd><char dialog="No, wait! You're soaking me, you're soaking me!" name="ELAINE" /><sd>The florist notices what he's done and turns off the hose.</sd><sd>Lobby)</sd><sd>Jerry sits beside Kramer, who still looks unwell.

Hey everybody." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Whoah, Elaine! Once again, you've managed to top yourself. C'mon Jerry," name="LLOYD" /><sd>let's go. Car's out front.</sd><sd>Lloyd leaves. Jerry stands and peers about himself through the over-strength</sd><sd>glasses. All he can make out are vague blurred shapes.</sd><char dialog="Lloyd?" name="JERRY" /><sd>He moves across the lobby, slowly, holding his hands out to feel for obstacles.</sd><char dialog="Lloyd?" name="JERRY" /><sd>Jerry leaves.</sd><char dialog="(exasperated) What is Lloyd's problem?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Look, honey, I know you're trying to get Lloyd to notice you, but this" name="KRAMER" /><sd>is too much. Parading around in a wet T-shirt.</sd><char dialog="Uhh, I got sprayed with a hose." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Yeah, well, I'm sorry, but the Alex is a family theatre, not one of your" name="KRAMER" /><sd>swing joints.</sd><sd>Elaine casts her eyes heavenward.</sd><set>(Street Outside Alex)</set><sd>The remains of George's car are being towed away.

Listen, I know this all sounds a little" name="GEORGE" /><sd>crazy, but...</sd><sd>A car pulls up beside George and Deena. George looks in the window.</sd><char dialog="I can't believe it.

I'd love to lend it to you, but I doubt if it would fit a" name="HAARWOOD" /><sd>man of your impressive, Raymond Massey-like, physique.

Huh, so I had it all along. How d'you like that? (snorts) I guess" name="GEORGE" /><sd>I owe that cashier an apology.</sd><sd>Deena is walking toward George and Kramer.
