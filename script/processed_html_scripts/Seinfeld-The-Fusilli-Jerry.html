What, is it a problem?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Well, I think he could've asked me. Supposed to be a friend of mine." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Well, I guess he figured you just wouldn't care. It *has* been a few years." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Elaine, you always care who an ex-girlfriend dates. You don't want it to be someone you know, and you don't want it to be someone better than you. Now, even though the latter is *obviously* impossible." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Oh, god." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="The former still applies. I don't know what it is, but I just can't see you with a mechanic." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Oh, yeah. Right, right. Well, all those mechanics do is work all day with their hands and their *big*, *muscular* arms on machines, and then they come home dripping with animal sexuality like Stanley Kowalski. What a huge turn-off that is." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="All right." name="JERRY" /><set>(At Monk's, George and Estelle are looking over their menus)</set><char dialog="Look at that. They got lobster on the menu. Who would order a lobster here. I mean, do they bring a lobster in everyday hoping *todays* the day." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="So what if they have a lobster. Suddenly you're a shell-fish connoisseur." name="ESTELLE" /><char dialog="You know, I think we really need to be in front of a television set. You take T.V. out of this relationship, it is *just* torture." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="So, I'm getting an eye job." name="ESTELLE" /><char dialog="An eye job? Ma, you don't need an eye job." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Georgie, I'm a divorcee." name="ESTELLE" /><char dialog="No, you're not a divorcee. You're just separated.

I can't do it Tuesday.

He's good. He's *very* good. He worked on this kid" name="KRAMER" /><sd>from Guatemala with no nose. Turned him into Ricardo Montalban.</sd><char dialog="Hey, Kramer, what are you doing Tuesday?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Tuesday? Uh..." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Why doesn't *he* pick you up after the operation. He's got the car" name="GEORGE" /><sd>with the bench seats that you like.</sd><char dialog="Oh, I don't care." name="ESTELLE" /><char dialog="Yeah, I know, but I can't drive anybody anywhere until I go down to" name="KRAMER" /><sd>the motor vehicle bureau and get my new plates.</sd><char dialog="Well, giddy-up!" name="GEORGE" /><set>(At the motor vehicle bureau...)</set><char dialog="Yeah, I'm here to pick up my new plates.

There is no confusing *that* move with any other move." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="I can't believe it. He *stole* my move." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="What else did you tell (reaches over to slap Jerry) him. (does it" name="ELAINE" /><sd>again) The two of you must have had *quite* a little chat!</sd><char dialog="Oh, it wasn't like that! I didn't even mention you. You know, we" name="JERRY" /><sd>were in the garage. You know how garages are. They're conducive to sex</sd><sd>talk. It's a high-testosterone area.</sd><char dialog="Because of all the pistons and the lube jobs?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Well, I'm going down to that garage and telling him to stop doing it." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Well, wait---wait a second." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="What?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Isn't that a little...rash?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="No! He stole my move!" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah, but...*I* like the move." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Yeah, but it's like another comedian stealing my material." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Well, he doesn't even do it exactly the same. He--he--he uses a" name="ELAINE" /><sd>pinch at the end instead of the *swirl*!</sd><char dialog="Oh, yeah. The pinch. *I've* done the pinch. That's not new." name="JERRY" /><sd>Besides which, I don't know how you could trust any of his moves now. His</sd><sd>whole *repertoire* could be lifted.</sd><char dialog="You know, it's strange, because he's such an honest mechanic." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="I know, he's probably the only honest mechanic in New York." name="JERRY" /><sd>(Later, Jerry and George are outside, where Jerry has just bought a candy bar</sd><sd>at the newsstand)</sd><char dialog="...so he stole my move and he's using it on Elaine." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="You told David Putty your move and you didn't tell *me*? I *need* a" name="GEORGE" /><sd>move. You know I have no moves, Jerry. (points to the candy bar) Gimme a</sd><sd>bite.</sd><char dialog="Can I just get it opened first?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I can't believe you're hoarding sex moves. I'm out there rubbing" name="GEORGE" /><sd>two sticks together. You walk around with a zippo.</sd><char dialog="All right, all right. Here.

That's very good." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="You feel better?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah, much better. All right, so what's the move, because I need" name="GEORGE" /><sd>*something*. This woman I'm dating, it's like she's doing her nails during</sd><sd>love-making.</sd><char dialog="Nancy Klopper?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah. Never seen anyone so bored. I'm working like a dog here." name="GEORGE" /><sd>Give me a moan. *Something*. I'd settle for a belch, for god's sake. All</sd><sd>right, come on, let's have it.</sd><char dialog="All right, George. I'm gonna tell you. But I just wanna make sure," name="JERRY" /><sd>before---</sd><char dialog="Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's in the vault. I'm putting it in the vault." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="It's not even a question of that. The point is when something like" name="JERRY" /><sd>this is passed along, one must be certain that it's going to be used in a</sd><sd>*conscientious* way. This is not some parlor trick to be used---</sd><char dialog="You're gonna tell me...or not." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="All right. On your bed. You got a headboard? You'll need a" name="JERRY" /><sd>headboard.</sd><char dialog="I got a headboard." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Is it padded?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Good. How tall is she?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Five-foot four. Why?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="You can't have more than a one-foot differential in your heights." name="JERRY" /><sd>Otherwise, you could really hurt your neck.</sd><char dialog="I can't tell ya how much I appreciate this." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="George, if you could master this, you'll never be alone again." name="JERRY" /><sd>Jerry and George have just walked in, still</sd><sd>conversing on the same subject)</sd><char dialog="Now, the ending is kind of an option. I use the swirl. I like the" name="JERRY" /><sd>swirl. I'm comfortable with the swirl. *I* feel the swirl is a great</sd><sd>capper. He uses the pinch, which I find a little presumptuous.</sd><char dialog="Is it a clockwise swirl?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I prefer clockwise, but it's not written in stone." name="JERRY" /><sd>(Kramer enters, holding an object of some kind).</sd><char dialog="Here you go, buddy. (shows it to Jerry)." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="What is it?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="*Fusilli* Jerry! It's made from Fusilli pasta. See the microphone?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="When did you do this?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="In my spare time. (turns to George). You know, I'm working on one" name="KRAMER" /><sd>of you, George. I'm using ravioli. See, the hard part is to find a pasta</sd><sd>that captures the individual.</sd><char dialog="Oh... Why Fusilli?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Because *you're* silly. Get it? (hands the Fusilli to Jerry)" name="KRAMER" /><sd>Yeah...</sd><char dialog="Well, thank you very much." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="So, did you get your new plates?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Oh...yeah. I got my new plates. But they mixed them up. Somebody" name="KRAMER" /><sd>got mine and I got their *vanity* plates.</sd><char dialog="What do they say?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Assman." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Assman?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah. Assman, Jerry. I'm Cosmo Kramer, the Assman!" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Who would order a license plate that says &quot;Assman&quot;?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Maybe they're Wilt Chamberlain's." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="It doesn't have to be someone who gets a lot of women. It could be" name="JERRY" /><sd>just some guy with a big ass.</sd><char dialog="Yeah, or it could be a proctologist." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Yeah. Proctologist." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Come on! No doctor would put that on his car." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Have you ever *met* a proctologist? Well, they usually have a very" name="KRAMER" /><sd>good sense of humor. You meet a proctologist at a party, don't walk away.</sd><sd>*Plant* yourself there, because you will hear the funniest stories you've</sd><sd>ever heard. See, no one wants to admit to them that they *stuck* something</sd><sd>up there. Never! It's always an accident.

There's my phone.

You used it on" name="JERRY" /><sd>Elaine.</sd><char dialog="You're move? What, are you kidding? I was doing that before I knew" name="DAVID" /><sd>you. All you told me about was the ending.</sd><char dialog="The ending is the whole thing.

I didn't need you to tell me that stupid twist.</sd><char dialog="Swirl." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Whatever. I don't even do it." name="DAVID" /><char dialog="Oh, yeah, I know. You do the *pinch*." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah, that's right." name="DAVID" /><char dialog="You can't come up with your own stuff , so you *steal* other peoples?" name="JERRY" /><sd>You're nothing but a hack.</sd><char dialog="Are you through, 'cuz, uh, I gotta get back to work." name="DAVID" /><char dialog="Well, I'll tell you what I'll do, you know.
