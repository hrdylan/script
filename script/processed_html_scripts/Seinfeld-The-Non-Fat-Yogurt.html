Okay." name="ELAINE" /><sd>I got a place that can analyze it. It's in Brooklyn.

Oh, that Lloyd: Braun. He is something, isn't he?" name="MOM" /><sd>Newman Well, I wouldn't hear of it. I said, "Nice try, granny!"

I've been waiting for something like this my whole life! And it's finally here!</sd><sd>Owner Hey, Seinfeld. I'd appreciate it if you'd stop using obscenities</sd><sd>around my son, huh?</sd><char dialog="It was an accident. I'm going to talk to him." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I want a small, plain vanilla in a cup to go. That's non-fat," name="ELAINE" /><sd>right?</sd><sd>Owner That's right.</sd><char dialog="'Cause I'm on a special diet, and the doctor said I can't have" name="ELAINE" /><sd>any fat.</sd><sd>Owner Yeah, well, there is no fat.</sd><sd>Newman Hey, another round of strawberry for me and my friends.</sd><char dialog="Hurry, Jerry! Hurry!" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="How's it doing?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Not too good." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Well, you can't have this tested now. It's melting." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="So what." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="It changes the molecules." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Oh, you don't know what you're talking about." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Hey, fatso!

I called earlier about getting the yogurt tested." name="ELAINE" /><sd>Labbie Oh, right. Would you fill this out, please?</sd><char dialog="Yeah. Oh, does it matter if it's melted?" name="ELAINE" /><sd>Labbie No! You know, this is going to take a couple of days.</sd><char dialog="That's okay." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Hello, there." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Hello!" name="LABBETTE" /><char dialog="Ooh! Test tubes. Cool!" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="What do you got there?" name="JERRY" /><sd>Labbie Actually, this is Mr. Giuliani's blood. We're doing a</sd><sd>cholesterol work up on it.</sd><char dialog="Oh." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Okay, I'm done." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="It was really nice meeting you." name="LABBETTE" /><char dialog="Well, the pleasure's all mine." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="You can't take that chemist out." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Why not?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Because she's like the jury. She's going to be sequestered." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I'm not taking her out just to influence the results." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Well, I think the whole thing stinks." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="It smells. Smells bad. Smells really bad." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="That's enough." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="What?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Well, with the smells." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="So, he made an appointment for me to see Dinkins' doctor." name="GEORGE" /><sd>He's just trying to humiliate me.</sd><char dialog="Uh-huh." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="And I have to go. If I don't go, he'll know I'm lying." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Well, so, what are you going to do? Sit in the doctor's office" name="JERRY" /><sd>doing this? He's going to think you're a mental patient.</sd><char dialog="I don't care. Look, Lloyd: doesn't know what he's up against." name="GEORGE" /><sd>This is nothing to me. My whole life is a lie.</sd><char dialog="Hey!" name="ELAINE" /><sd>G&amp;J Hey.</sd><char dialog="So, guess who called me." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Oh, don't tell me. Lloyd?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="We're going out tomorrow night." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Oh, look, he's going to ask you about my arm. So, just tell" name="GEORGE" /><sd>him I banged it against a desk. And it's been moving involuntarily ever since.</sd><char dialog="I can't say that." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Why not?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="What if I like him? I'm going to start out lying to this guy?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="So, you're taking his side?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="No. But what if we get married or something? We'll always" name="ELAINE" /><sd>have that between us.</sd><char dialog="Already you're marrying this guy?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="You never know." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="All right, believe me, you're not going to marry him." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="All right, well, then what if we become a couple, George?" name="ELAINE" /><sd>Every time we see you you're going to be walking around going like this? Even you can't keep that up.</sd><char dialog="No, I believe he can." name="JERRY" /><sd>Lady Hi!</sd><char dialog="Hi!" name="JERRY" /><sd>Lady You know Jerry.</sd><sd>Son Of course, he's the funny *beep*er.</sd><sd>Lady See!</sd><char dialog="Listen, Matthew, I want to explain something to you. Now," name="JERRY" /><sd>cursing is not something that most comedians do.</sd><sd>Son You did it.</sd><char dialog="That's true. But it was an accident. And I haven't done it" name="JERRY" /><sd>since. And I would never do it again. And if you continue cursing, you'll never become a comedian like me when you grow up. Excuse me one second.</sd><char dialog="You know, Lloyd: advises Dinkins on everything he does." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Yeah, yeah. Big advisor." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="He tells him which soap to use." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="What the *beep* are you doing? You little piece of *beep*." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Shh! We don't want to disturb the security guard." name="LABBETTE" /><char dialog="Where's the lights. Whoa!" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="How about this?" name="LABBETTE" /><char dialog="Yeah! Bunsen burner. You want a taste? It's Cappuccino." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="It's delicious." name="LABBETTE" /><char dialog="I hear you." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Non-fat?" name="LABBETTE" /><char dialog="Well, you tell me. Is the verdict in yet?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="No." name="LABBETTE" /><char dialog="Well, this is in case there's a tie!" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Well, as far as I know, he bumped his arm into a door and" name="ELAINE" /><sd>it's kind of got this involuntarily movement. Some sort of a</sd><sd>spasm. So, anyway, you're a big advisor to Dinkins, huh?</sd><char dialog="Yeah, yeah. It's coming right down to the wire." name="LLOYD" /><char dialog="Wow! You know what I would do if I was running for" name="ELAINE" /><sd>mayor. One of my campaign themes would be that everybody should wear name tags all the time to make the city friendlier.</sd><char dialog="Name tags, hmm?" name="LLOYD" /><char dialog="Well, everybody would know everybody. It would be like a" name="ELAINE" /><sd>small town.</sd><char dialog="Maybe I'll mention that to him." name="LLOYD" /><char dialog="Really? Wow!" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="You sure you don't want any yogurt?" name="LLOYD" /><char dialog="No, I'm watching my weight." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Well, it's nonfat." name="LLOYD" /><char dialog="Yeah, so they say." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Well, should we go?" name="LLOYD" /><char dialog="Yeah. Okay." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Three days and he hasn't called me, and you know why?" name="ELAINE" /><sd>Because he thinks I'm too fat.</sd><char dialog="He said that?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No, but I saw the look on his face when he put his arm" name="ELAINE" /><sd>around me. And then we went to his apartment, and I sat on one of his chairs and it broke. And he says, "Boy, you're a</sd><sd>lot of woman!"</sd><char dialog="Hey! So, hear anything on the yogurt?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="No, but I expect to hear anytime." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Well, I wouldn't get your hopes up." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Why do you say that?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No reason. Oh, did you hear about that Dinkins?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="No. What about him?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="You didn't hear?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Un-huh." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="He's proposing a plan where everyone in the city should wear" name="KRAMER" /><sd>name tags.</sd><char dialog="Name tags?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah! So people can go around saying &quot;hello&quot; to one another." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Oh, I see. So you can go, &quot;Hey, you know who I saw" name="JERRY" /><sd>wilding today? Herb!"</sd><char dialog="He's become the laughing stock! You know The Times has" name="KRAMER" /><sd>already stated it could cost him the election. Name tags!</sd><char dialog="Hello? Yes. Uh-huh. Yeah. Oh, really? Okay, thank you" name="JERRY" /><sd>very much. Bye-bye. Well, the yogurt verdict is in. Fat!</sd><char dialog="Yeow!" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="The next morning, I woke up, and it was going like this. I" name="GEORGE" /><sd>can control it if I really concentrate. But otherwise, oh!</sd><char dialog="Yes, well, I'm going to have to be perfectly honest with you." name="DOCTOR" /><char dialog="Please, doctor." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I've examined you." name="DOCTOR" /><char dialog="Yes." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I've looked at your X-rays." name="DOCTOR" /><char dialog="Uh-huh." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="And I find that there's absolutely nothing wrong with you." name="DOCTOR" /><char dialog="Hmm. Really? Nothing?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Nothing that would indicate involuntary spasms." name="DOCTOR" /><char dialog="Well, it's kind of a mystery, isn't it?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="No, not really." name="DOCTOR" /><char dialog="How so?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="May I suggest the possibility that you're faking?" name="DOCTOR" /><char dialog="Faking? What makes you think that I have time to see" name="GEORGE" /><sd>doctors, take X-rays, make appointments, when there's absolutely nothing wrong with me? What kind of a person would do a thing like that?</sd><char dialog="I don't know what kind of a person would do something like" name="DOCTOR" /><sd>that. Obviously a very sick person. A very immature person.</sd><sd>A person who has no regard for wasting other people's valuable time. Good-bye.</sd><char dialog="Now, see here, doctor." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I said, good-bye." name="DOCTOR" /><char dialog="Fine. Ow!" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Jerry, come on, look. Let's go over to that yogurt store." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Look, Elaine, I've been thinking about this. This has got to" name="JERRY" /><sd>be a massive conspiracy. Who knows how deep it goes. Hey, look, wait a second, Kramer, turn that up.</sd><char dialog="Okay." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Rudy Giuliani, who underwent a physical last week, received" name="NEWS" /><sd>some startling news today when his cholesterol count turned</sd><sd>out to be a whopping 375. What effect this will have on the</sd><sd>minds of the voters remains to be seen. In another development, Mayor Dinkins has fired his top advisor, Lloyd</sd><sd>Braun, who is believed to be responsible for the name tag fiasco. We now take you to Giuliani headquarters where Rudy</sd><sd>Giuliani is about to make a statement.</sd><char dialog="It's hard to understand. Because I've been doing everything I" name="GIULIANI" /><sd>normally do. I've been watching my diet very carefully. I exercise regularly. My only indulgence, I guess, would be that</sd><sd>I eat a lot of frozen yogurt. But it's non-fat.</sd><char dialog="Yogurt? Oh, my god. They got Giuliani and he doesn't even" name="JERRY" /><sd>know it.</sd><char dialog="Now look what you've done." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Well, we've got to do something. I'm calling Giuliani's" name="JERRY" /><sd>headquarters.</sd><char dialog="Name tags! Name tags! What kind of an idiot thinks" name="GEORGE" /><sd>anybody would be interested in an idea like that.</sd><sd>Dad I don't think it's so bad. People should wear name tags.</sd><sd>Everyone would be a lot friendlier. "Hello, Sam." "How are you doing, Joe?" Hey, your arm. It moved again. I thought you said it went away.</sd><char dialog="I banged it on the desk in the doctor's office. And . . ." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Be quiet. They're starting the press conference." name="MOM" /><sd>Giuliani My campaign staff has received some very disturbing</sd><sd>information regarding the fat content in yogurt that's being</sd><sd>sold throughout the city. I pledge to you now, that if I'm elected mayor, as my first order of business I'll appoint a</sd><sd>special task force to investigate this matter. I promise you,</sd><sd>my fellow New Yorkers, that Mayor Giuliani will do everything possible to cleanse this city of this falsified non-fat</sd><sd>yogurt.</sd><char dialog="The old yogurt was so much better. Oh, this is terrible." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Phew!" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Oh, it stinks." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Mine, too. I got one more day." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="I can't eat this." name="JERRY" /><sd>Newman Hey, Jerry. Thanks a lot. I hope you're happy.</sd><char dialog="It had fat in it, it's not good for you." name="JERRY" /><sd>Newman I don't care. It was good. I was enjoying it. Had to</sd><sd>interfere. Couldn't leave well enough alone. Well, I will get</sd><sd>even with you for this. You can count on it.</sd><char dialog="Hey, you guys, listen to this. Listen to this. Apparently" name="ELAINE" /><sd>some blood spilled into Mr. Giuliani's test tube causing his</sd><sd>cholesterol count to be 150 points higher than was initially</sd><sd>reported. Ironically, the mishap by bringing the non-fat yogurt</sd><sd>scandal to the attention of the public, probably clinched the</sd><sd>election for the Republican. It was the one issue which seemed to electrify the voters and swept Giuliani into office.</sd><char dialog="So, in effect, the yogurt won him the election." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I wonder what actually happened in that lab." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Yeah, me, too." name="KRAMER" /><sd>Newman I can't eat this.</sd><char dialog="Thanks for ruining my daddy's business, you fat *beep*!" name="BOY" /><char dialog="" name="THE END" /></root>
