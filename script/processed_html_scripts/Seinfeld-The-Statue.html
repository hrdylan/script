Well, I will tell you what I know so far. According to the information that I have in the envelope that I've received, it seems that I may have already won some very valuable prizes. Well, thank you, thank you very much, well thank you. It's very nice to hear that. But, in all honesty, I have to say, I didn't even know I was in this thing. But, according to the readout, it looks like I am among the top people that they are considering. You know, that's what annoys me about the sweepstakes companies, they always tease you with that, &quot;You may have already won.&quot; I'd like once for a sweepstakes company to have some guts, come out with the truth, just tell people the truth one time. Send out envelopes, &quot;You have definitely lost!&quot; You turn it over, giant printing, &quot;Not even close!&quot; You open it up, there's this whole letter of explanation, &quot;Even we cannot believe how badly you've done in this contest.&quot;" name="JERRY" /><set>(Scene ends) (Jerry's apartment)</set><set>(George is reading the paper.
