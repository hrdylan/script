The last thing he needs is Mrs Choate connecting him with</sd><sd>New York.</sd><char dialog="Yeah. I was visiting my daughter, and I'll never go back. The crime" name="MRS.

Kramer begins to walk faster, then breaks into a run.</sd><set>(Another Street)</set><sd>Kramer slows from his run, and looks behind himself. A smile comes to his face,</sd><sd>as he sees the truck is no longer there. He allows himself a little shrug of</sd><sd>satisfaction at having beaten the cable guy. Kramer turns and begins to walk on,</sd><sd>with his groceries, when there is a screech of tyres and the cable truck comes</sd><sd>to a halt in front of him - having taken another route to head him off.</sd><sd>The cable guy gives a 'come here' gesture with his forefinger through the truck</sd><sd>window. Kramer turns and sets off running. He runs into a litter bin, drops his</sd><sd>groceries and falls to the floor. The cable guy climbs from his truck and begins</sd><sd>to advance on Kramer.

He comes to the edge of the roof and</sd><sd>looks for a way across to the next building. Kramer looks worriedly behind him,</sd><sd>for the pursuing cable guy, then down into the gap between buildings. Despite</sd><sd>his worry at the height, he steps back a few paces, takes a run-up, and leaps</sd><sd>across to land on the roof of the next building. Kramer picks himself up and</sd><sd>sets off running again. Behind him, the cable guy comes to the same gap, looks</sd><sd>down at how far he has to fall, and thinks better of attempting the leap.</sd><char dialog="(yelling after the fleeing Kramer) I'll get you!

(upset) I</sd><sd>guess maybe we just kind of enjoy taking advantage of people. (reasonable) Well,</sd><sd>that's gonna change. From now on, no more 'nine to twelve', no more 'one to</sd><sd>five'. We're gonna have appointments. Eleven o'clock is gonna mean eleven</sd><sd>o'clock. And, if we can't make it, we're gonna call you, tell you why. (worked</sd><sd>up) For god's sakes, if a doctor can do it, why can't we? (almost sobbing)</sd><sd>Anyway, that's it.</sd><sd>The cable guy sighs, and begins to walk away. Kramer's door opens, and Kramer</sd><sd>emerges. He and Nick look at each other apologetically for a few seconds. Then</sd><sd>Kramer steps forward and they hug.</sd><set>(Morty and Helen's, Florida)</set><sd>Morty comes in from the bedroom, looking around at his home.

Morty</sd><sd>waits a second or two, having a final look round the room. He stands by the</sd><sd>door, then steels himself. Giving a determined nod, he exits, closing the door</sd><sd>behind him.</sd><set>(Outside Morty and Helen's, Florida)</set><sd>The Seinfelds walk, three abreast, toward the Cadillac. As they walk, they pass the other residents, who have come to see them off. They nod acknowledgement. As they get to the car, Helen and Jerry get in, but Morty stands in the open door of the Cadillac, turns to the assembled throng and gives a big smile, and arms-wide gesture (like Nixon leaving the White House), before climbing into the car. The residents wave back, one or two of them in tears, and Morty slowly drives the Cadillac away.</sd><char dialog="" name="THE END" /></root>
