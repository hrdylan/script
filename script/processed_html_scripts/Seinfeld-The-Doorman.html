A doorman, stood</sd><sd>reading a newspaper on a counter, objects. There's an undertone to the doorman's</sd><sd>voice - unfriendly, contemptuous, even an edge of menace.</sd><char dialog="Whoah, whoah, whoah.

I" name="DOORMAN" /><sd>should just shut up and do my job, opening the door for you.</sd><sd>The doorman wanders back to his newspaper. Jerry shrugs and pushes the button</sd><sd>for one of the elevators. There's a pause as he waits for it to arrive. The</sd><sd>doorman stands holding his paper, staring at Jerry, with the unfriendly smile on</sd><sd>his face. Jerry throws a smile of his own back. The elevator is still not</sd><sd>moving. Jerry tries to break the uncomfortable silence.</sd><char dialog="How 'bout those Knicks?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Oh, I see.

It gives him an idea. Kramer steps in front of George and</sd><sd>brings them to a halt.</sd><char dialog="Hey, George, stick 'em up." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="What?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="For these German tourists. Pretend that I'm robbing you." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Why?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="So these people can go back home and tell their friends they saw a real" name="KRAMER" /><sd>New York mugging.

They look out the</sd><sd>window at the 'mugging'. George has his hands up, and Kramer is feeling through</sd><sd>George's pockets with his free hand.</sd><char dialog="That's it. Now, gimme your wallet. Got it in here, huh, fat boy!" name="KRAMER" /><sd>The tourist are looking out of the bus. Shocked, they knock on the glass.

They simultaneously look at their</sd><sd>watches.</sd><set>(George's Apartment)</set><sd>George and Kramer wear their jackets, ready to leave.

Can we go out and eat?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="(putting down the bowl) Lemme change my shirt." name="FRANK" /><sd>George and Kramer stand together, by George's computer. Frank unfastens his</sd><sd>shirt and opens it. Kramer and George turn and see Frank's torso exposed as the</sd><sd>shirt comes off. Kramer's eyebrows go up in surprise. George looks horrified,</sd><sd>and puts his hand to his mouth like he's going to vomit.</sd><set>(Mr. Pitt's Apartment)</set><sd>Elaine still sits on the couch. Jerry is standing at the window, holding the</sd><sd>curtain open and looking down at the street.</sd><char dialog="Jerry, it's six.

Jerry is nearer, so he moves to answer it.</sd><char dialog="No, don't..." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="(picks up phone) Hello? (listens) Oh, hi Mr. Pitt." name="JERRY" /><sd>Elaine looks exasperated.</sd><char dialog="(quietly) Give that to me." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="(taking the phone) Hello Mr. Pitt. How's Scotland?" name="ELAINE" /><sd>Mr. Pitt sits in a comfortable chair in Scotland.</sd><char dialog="(concerned) Elaine, are you having a party?" name="MR. PITT" /><char dialog="A party. Oh no, that was just my stupid friend Jerry." name="ELAINE" /><sd>Jerry is peering out of the window again.</sd><char dialog="Alright, he just left. We can go." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="(stern) Because there's to be no entertaining while I'm gone." name="MR. PITT" /><char dialog="Believe me, we're not entertained. We were just leaving. (to Jerry) Oh," name="ELAINE" /><sd>can you grab those empty bottles for me.</sd><sd>Jerry picks up a paper sack of empty bottles from the floor by the desk.</sd><char dialog="I need to know what's in the mail." name="MR.

We're trying" name="ELAINE" /><sd>to catch a movie.</sd><char dialog="(resolute) Well, you better catch the later show, because I need to" name="MR. PITT" /><sd>know what's in the mail.</sd><char dialog="Alright. (to Jerry, upset) I can't go." name="ELAINE" /><sd>Jerry gives an irritated glance upwards and goes to leave.</sd><set>(Lobby, Mr. Pitt's Building)</set><sd>Jerry emerges from the elevator (without the bottles). There is a new doorman on</sd><sd>duty, who gives Jerry a friendly nod and smile and holds the door open for him.</sd><sd>Jerry nods and smiles back, and leaves.</sd><set>(Mr. Pitt's Apartment)</set><sd>Elaine is kneeling with the phone. She has Mr. Pitt's mail spread out on the</sd><sd>floor in front of her and is going through it for Mr. Pitt's benefit.</sd><char dialog="...Uhm, the new Time magazine. The new People..." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="(piqued interest) Oh, who's on the cover?" name="MR. PITT" /><set>(Street)</set><sd>Jerry walks down the street. He passes a doorway, where stands a familiar</sd><sd>figure. The doorman still has the attitude problem.</sd><char dialog="Hey, buddy." name="DOORMAN" /><char dialog="(surprise) You? Wh...what're you doing here? You work at this building" name="JERRY" /><sd>too?</sd><char dialog="Ah, sure. Poor doorman has to work two jobs to put food on the table" name="DOORMAN" /><sd>for mother and baby. (supercilious) No, I live here. That's okay, isn't it?</sd><char dialog="So you work all day as a doorman at one building. Then you come home and" name="JERRY" /><sd>stand outside your own building?</sd><char dialog="You got a problem with that?" name="DOORMAN" /><char dialog="Look, I'm not going in your building. I really don't have to talk to you." name="JERRY" /><sd>Goodbye.</sd><sd>Jerry walks away.</sd><char dialog="(calling after Jerry) You really think you're better than me, don't" name="DOORMAN" /><sd>you?!</sd><set>(Monk's)</set><sd>George and Kramer sit one side of a booth, facing Jerry. George is wearing a</sd><sd>purple shirt. Kramer's eating a sandwich heartily. George looks as if he might</sd><sd>never want to eat again.</sd><char dialog="My father opened his shirt..." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Yeah, and?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="(nods to Kramer) Tell him, Kramer." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="(matter of fact) He had breasts." name="KRAMER" /><sd>George nods, Jerry has a confused expression. Kramer keeps on eating. Jerry</sd><sd>thinks for a moment, George can't even look anyone in the eye.</sd><char dialog="What d'you mean, breasts?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="(waves his hands) Big breasts!" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="So what? A lot of older men have that." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No, not these. These were real hooters." name="KRAMER" /><sd>Jerry pulls a face at the thought.</sd><char dialog="I was throwing up all night. It was like my own personal Crying Game." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Well, maybe you're gonna get 'em too, George." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="(worried) Yeah, that's right. What if it's a genetic thing, like father" name="GEORGE" /><sd>like son?</sd><char dialog="But, your father's not bald." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No, no no. That skips a generation. The baldness gene comes from your" name="GEORGE" /><sd>grandfather.</sd><char dialog="Then I suppose the bosom gene comes from your grandmother." name="JERRY" /><sd>George snaps his finger and points, in agreement with Jerry. He continues to</sd><sd>look deeply worried.</sd><char dialog="You know, Frank can't be too comfortable with those things clanging" name="KRAMER" /><sd>around. He should wear something for support.</sd><char dialog="You mean like a bra?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="A bra is for ladies. I'm talking about a support undergarment" name="KRAMER" /><sd>specifically designed for men.</sd><char dialog="Boy, that brain never stops working, does it?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I tell you, I'm gonna go noodle with this." name="KRAMER" /><sd>Kramer leaves. A buxom blonde woman in a purple shirt is making her way to the</sd><sd>door, as she passes the booth she notices George.</sd><char dialog="(indicating her shirt with her finger) Hey, we're twins." name="BUXOM WOMAN" /><char dialog="(thinking she means the breasts) What!!" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Our shirts. They're the same." name="BUXOM WOMAN" /><char dialog="Oh, Huh, imagine that." name="GEORGE" /><sd>The woman smiles and leaves. Elaine enters Monk's and comes over to Jerry. She's</sd><sd>not happy about something.</sd><char dialog="(to Jerry) What? What'd you say to the doorman?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="What? Nothing." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="(sitting beside Jerry) He claims that you followed him home, and started" name="ELAINE" /><sd>harassing him.</sd><char dialog="What has this guy got a personal vendetta with me?! What'd I do to him?" name="JERRY" /><sd>'Cos I asked him about the Knicks?</sd><char dialog="Hey, did you make the movie?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="No." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="You wanna go tonight? You can pick me up." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Alright. Can we go to a later show, so he's off his shift when I come by?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Ugh. So now we have to rearrange our lives to avoid the doorman?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Yes, we do." name="JERRY" /><sd>Elaine looks over at George, wondering what he's doing. George is holding the</sd><sd>neck of his shirt open, and is peering down the inside of the garment at his</sd><sd>chest. As Elaine and Jerry watch, George jiggles his upper body, to see if</sd><sd>there's any movement.</sd><char dialog="What is wrong with George?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="He's... trying to get something off his chest." name="JERRY" /><sd>George ends his experiment, and rises to leave. He digs in his wallet to pay the</sd><sd>cheque.</sd><char dialog="(agitated) Alright, I gotta try and talk my mother into taking him off" name="GEORGE" /><sd>my hands.</sd><set>(Lobby, Mr. Pitt's Building)</set><sd>Jerry enters from the street, only to find the unpleasant doorman standing</sd><sd>inside the lobby. The doorman's demeanour hasn't improved.</sd><char dialog="Help you?" name="DOORMAN" /><char dialog="(jumps in surprise) Hoh! What're you doing here? You're supposed to be" name="JERRY" /><sd>gone.</sd><char dialog="I traded shifts with the night doorman. He had some personal affairs to" name="DOORMAN" /><sd>attend to. You see, my fellow doorman and I watch out for each other. We don't</sd><sd>stab each other in the back, like people in your world.</sd><char dialog="(trying to ease the tension) Look, I don't want any trouble. I don't have" name="JERRY" /><sd>a doorman in my building. I guess I'm just not used to talking to them. I'd</sd><sd>really just like to be friends.</sd><char dialog="You wanna be friends?" name="DOORMAN" /><char dialog="I'd like to be." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Then watch the door for a minute, would you?" name="DOORMAN" /><sd>The doorman swaps places with Jerry, putting Jerry beside the counter.</sd><char dialog="What?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah, I just wanna run and get a beer. I'll be back in a minute." name="DOORMAN" /><char dialog="Wha...? Wai... wait a second. What do I do?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="It's not brain surgery. You open the door for people who live here." name="DOORMAN" /><sd>And, if they don't live here, don't let them in. (takes off his hat) Here.</sd><sd>(putting it on Jerry's head) Wear that.</sd><char dialog="Oh." name="JERRY" /><sd>The doorman goes out the door. Jerry takes off the hat, which he's not thrilled</sd><sd>about wearing, and leans on the counter. The doors of an elevator open, and a</sd><sd>young woman pushing a baby buggy emerges and heads for the exit. After a second,</sd><sd>Jerry realises his job. He puts on the hat and opens the door to allow the woman</sd><sd>to leave. AS he opens the door, a man enters and strolls past Jerry into the</sd><sd>elevator vacated by the woman.</sd><char dialog="(to the man in the elevator) Hey, hey. Wait a second. Hey! Hello!" name="JERRY" /><sd>The man takes no notice of Jerry, the doors close. The street door opens and</sd><sd>another, older guy, enters. Jerry moves and challenges him.</sd><char dialog="Hey, hey, wait a second. You live here?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="(indignant) Of course I live here. I've lived here for twenty years." name="MR. GREEN" /><sd>Now, if you don't let me in, I'm going to call the police and have you arrested.</sd><sd>Jerry steps aside and motions for the guy to carry on into the building, but he</sd><sd>looks resentful about it.</sd><char dialog="(after the guy) You think you're better than me?" name="JERRY" /><set>(Bus)</set><sd>George is riding the bus. As the vehicle travels along the street, it rattles,</sd><sd>shakes and shudders like all poorly maintained public transport. George is</sd><sd>strap-hanging, and he gets a worried look as he feels there might be some</sd><sd>movement on his chest. He puts his hands on his chest, then notices another guy</sd><sd>on the buss looking at him. Self-consciously, George pulls his coat tight shut,</sd><sd>and crosses his arms firmly.</sd><set>(Lobby, Mr. Pitt's Building)</set><sd>Jerry is standing behind the counter, reading the doorman's newspaper. A FedEx</sd><sd>delivery guy enters with a package, lays it on the counter and scans a barcode</sd><sd>on it with a little device he takes from his pocket. Jerry watches,</sd><sd>disinterested. There is a brief pause, as the FedEx guy waits for something.</sd><char dialog="(indicating) You have to sign for it." name="DELIVERY GUY" /><char dialog="Oh, right." name="JERRY" /><sd>Jerry takes the FedEx guy's pen and signs for the package, then goes back to the</sd><sd>newspaper.</sd><char dialog="(with a smile) Hey, how 'bout those Knicks, huh?" name="DELIVERY GUY" /><sd>Jerry gives the guy a hostile look, much as the doorman might.</sd><char dialog="(dismissive) Yeah, yeah, yeah." name="JERRY" /><sd>The FedEx guy leaves, looking a touch unhappy at Jerry's attitude. Jerry puts</sd><sd>the paper down, and goes to have a look through the door. There's no sign of the</sd><sd>doorman, so Jerry tosses the hat onto the counter, dismissing it with a wave of</sd><sd>the hand as he moves to the elevator.</sd><set>(George's Apartment)</set><sd>Frank opens the door, to reveal Kramer, carrying a large portable record player.</sd><char dialog="Hey. I uh, brought back your record player, huh." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Thank you, Kramer." name="FRANK" /><char dialog="Yeah." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="(indicating a chair) Put it over there." name="FRANK" /><sd>Kramer dumps the record player on the chair. Frank goes to the couch, not moving</sd><sd>very easily.</sd><char dialog="So, how you feeling?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Tired." name="FRANK" /><char dialog="Uh huh. Your back hurt?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="How did you know?" name="FRANK" /><char dialog="Well, it's obvious, you know. You're carrying a lot of extra baggage up" name="KRAMER" /><sd>there.</sd><char dialog="(looks down, and indicates his chest) Up here?" name="FRANK" /><char dialog="Oh, yeah. Top floor. (sits beside Frank) Listen, Frank, have you ever" name="KRAMER" /><sd>considered wearing something for support? Now, look at this. (reaches into his</sd><sd>pocket) Mind you, this is just a prototype.</sd><sd>Kramer brings out a garment constructed of canvas and elasticated fabric.</sd><char dialog="You want me to wear a bra?!" name="FRANK" /><char dialog="No, no. A bra is for ladies." name="KRAMER" /><sd>Kramer holds the garment up to his own chest.</sd><char dialog="Meet, the bro." name="KRAMER" /><set>(Estelle's Car)</set><sd>Estelle is driving a preoccupied-looking George.</sd><char dialog="So, is your father excited about coming home?" name="ESTELLE" /><sd>George is miles away.</sd><char dialog="George?" name="ESTELLE" /><char dialog="(broaching a subject) Hey mom. What kind of woman was grandma?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="All of a sudden you're interested in your grandmother?" name="ESTELLE" /><char dialog="Well, you know. You get to a certain point, you wanna know about your" name="GEORGE" /><sd>roots.</sd><char dialog="She was a lovely woman." name="ESTELLE" /><char dialog="Yuh. What about physically?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Physically?" name="ESTELLE" /><char dialog="Yeah, you know, what'd she uh, look like?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Well, you've seen pictures." name="ESTELLE" /><char dialog="(to himself) You can't tell much from those pictures." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="So what?" name="ESTELLE" /><char dialog="Was she uh, was she a big, uh woman?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Big? No, just my height." name="ESTELLE" /><char dialog="Bosomy?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Bosomy? You wanna know if your grandmother was bosomy?!" name="ESTELLE" /><char dialog="(trying to laugh it off) No, I was just wondering. The information could" name="GEORGE" /><sd>be relevant.</sd><char dialog="Where do you get your genes from?!" name="ESTELLE" /><char dialog="(to himself) That's what I'd like to know." name="GEORGE" /><set>(Elevator, Mr. Pitt's Building)</set><sd>Elaine and Jerry ride down.</sd><char dialog="I can't believe you left your post." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="He left me there. You see the mind games?" name="JERRY" /><sd>The bell rings as they reach the lobby, and the doors open.</sd><set>(Lobby, Mr. Pitt's Building)</set><sd>Elaine and Jerry emerge into the lobby to find four or five tenants standing</sd><sd>around, and a uniformed cop taking notes.</sd><char dialog="(to one of the tenants) Hey, what's up? What's going on here?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Somebody stole the couch out of the lobby." name="TENANT 1" /><sd>Jerry and Elaine look shocked.</sd><char dialog="Where's the doorman? How come someone wasn't watching the door?" name="TENANT 2" /><char dialog="(quietly to Jerry) Jerry, let's get out of here." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Yeah." name="JERRY" /><sd>Elaine and Jerry depart the scene of the crime in some haste.</sd><set>(George's Apartment)</set><sd>Frank's cha-cha record is playing loudly on the record player.

They see the dancing twosome, and the undergarment, and look stunned.</sd><char dialog="(shocked) Oh, my god!" name="ESTELLE" /><sd>George is frozen, staring.
