Elaine changes the stations but all</sd><sd>of the presets are set to religious radio stations; "And he said unto</sd><sd>Abraham...", "Amen! Amen!", "So we pray...", "Saved!", "Jey-sus!" She turns</sd><sd>off the radio.</sd><char dialog="Jesus?" name="ELAINE" /><sd>Meeting at George's office. His Boss, Mr. Kruger, is speaking.</sd><char dialog="According to our latest quarterly thing,Kruger Industrial Smoothing is" name="KRUGER" /><sd>heading into the red. Or the black, or whatever the bad one is. Any thoughts?</sd><char dialog="Well, I know when I'm a little strapped, I sometimes drop off my rent" name="GEORGE" /><sd>check having forgotten to sign it. That could buy us some time.</sd><char dialog="Works for me. Good thinking, George." name="KRUGER" /><char dialog="Alright, George." name="CO-WORKER 1" /><char dialog="Way to go man." name="CO-WORKER 2" /><char dialog="Or we don't even send the check and then when they call, we pretend" name="GEORGE" /><sd>we're the cleaning service. Heh heh. "Hello? I sorry, no here Kruger."</sd><char dialog="Are you done? Silly voices, c'mon people, let's get real." name="KRUGER" /><char dialog="Good one." name="CO-WORKER 1" /><char dialog="That was bad." name="CO-WORKER 2" /><sd>George and Jerry are at the coffee shop.</sd><char dialog="I had 'em, Jerry. They loved me." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="And then?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I lost them. I can usually come up with one good comment during a" name="GEORGE" /><sd>meeting but by the end it's buried under a pile of gaffs and bad puns.</sd><char dialog="Showmanship, George. When you hit that high note, you say goodnight and" name="JERRY" /><sd>walk off.</sd><char dialog="I can't just leave." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="That's the way they do it in Vegas." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="You never played Vegas." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I hear things." name="JERRY" /><sd>Elaine enters and has a seat.</sd><char dialog="Here's one. I borrowed Puddy's car and all the presets on his radio" name="ELAINE" /><sd>were Christian rock stations.</sd><char dialog="I like Christian rock. It's very positive. It's not like those real" name="GEORGE" /><sd>musicians who think they're so cool and hip.</sd><char dialog="So, you think that Puddy actually believes in something?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="It's a used car, he probably never changed the presets." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yes, he is lazy." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Plus he probably doesn't even know how to program the buttons." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yes, he is dumb." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="So you prefer dumb and lazy to religious?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Dumb and lazy, I understand." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Tell you how you could check." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="How?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Reprogram all the buttons, see if he changes them back. You know? The" name="GEORGE" /><sd>old switcheroo.</sd><char dialog="No, no, the old switcheroo is you poison your drink then you switch it" name="JERRY" /><sd>with the other person's.</sd><char dialog="No, it's doing the same thing to someone that they did to you." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Yeah, Elaine's gonna do the same thing to Puddy's radio that the radio" name="JERRY" /><sd>did to her.</sd><char dialog="Well that's the gist of it!" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Quiet! So where is this Sophie?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Oh, she's picking me up in a few minutes." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="How long have you two been together?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="I dunno. Since the last one. Oh, here she is. You wanna meet her?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Nah." name="ELAINE AND GEORGE" /><sd>Jerry leaves to go meet Sophie by the register.</sd><char dialog="By the way, how did Puddy get back in the picture?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I needed to move a bureau." name="ELAINE" /><sd>Kramer and Mickey enter Jerry's apartment.</sd><char dialog="Hey Jerry, you got any pepper?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Hey Jerry." name="MICKEY" /><char dialog="Hey Mickey. Check the pepper shaker." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah. (inhales some pepper then sneezes violently) See? It should" name="KRAMER" /><sd>sound like that, something like that.</sd><char dialog="Aah-choo." name="MICKEY" /><char dialog="A little wetter. See, I didn't believe it." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="What's with the fake sneezing?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah, we're going down to Mt. Sinai Hospital, See they hire actors to" name="KRAMER" /><sd>help the students practice diagnosing.</sd><char dialog="They assign you a specific disease and you act out the symptoms. It's" name="MICKEY" /><sd>an easy gig.</sd><char dialog="Do medical schools actually do this?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Well the better ones. Alright, let's practice retching." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="" name="KRAMER AND MICKEY" /><char dialog="" name="HUAAHHH!!" /><char dialog="I think the phone is ringing." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="" name="KRAMER AND MICKEY" /><char dialog="" name="HUAAHHH!!" /><char dialog="Would you hold it a second?!

It's me." name="SOPHIE" /><char dialog="Elaine?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No, it's me." name="SOPHIE" /><char dialog="George??" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Jerry, it's Sophie. I can't believe you don't recognize my voice." name="SOPHIE" /><char dialog="Oh, I knew it was you, I was joking. I'm a comedian." name="JERRY" /><sd>Kramer enters.</sd><char dialog="You got any Ipecac?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Ipecac? Kramer, I really think you guys are going too far with this." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No, Mickey, he swallowed twelve aspirin." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Did he overdose?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No, it's just too much." name="KRAMER" /><sd>Office meeting at Kruger Industrial Smoothing.</sd><char dialog="...And it gets worse. The team working on the statue in Lafayette" name="KRUGER" /><sd>Square kind of over-smoothed it. They ground the head down to about the size of</sd><sd>a softball, and that spells trouble.</sd><char dialog="Alright, well why don't we smooth the head down to nothing, stick a" name="GEORGE" /><sd>pumpkin under its arm and change the nameplate to Ichabod Crane?</sd><sd>Everyone at the meeting breaks out in laughter.</sd><char dialog="Alright! That's it for me. Goodnight" name="GEORGE" /><sd>everybody.</sd><sd>Mt.

So that old woman, she's just a liar, right?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="And a bit of a tramp if you ask me." name="JERRY" /><sd>Elaine enters.</sd><char dialog="Hello boys." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Hey, so, did you give that radio the old switcheroo?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I did." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="And the Christian rock?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Ressurected! And look what I pried off of his bumper, a Jesus fish!" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Jerry, do you have any fishsticks?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="No. So you're disappointed he's a spiritual person?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Well yeah, I got him because he seemed so one-dimensional, I feel" name="ELAINE" /><sd>misled.</sd><char dialog="I think it's neat. You don't hear that much about god anymore." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I hear things. Hey, so Sophie gave me the &quot;It's me&quot; on the phone today." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="&quot;It's me?&quot; Isn't it a little premature?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="I thought so." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Hah. She's not a &quot;me&quot;. I'm a &quot;me&quot;." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="I'm against all &quot;it's me&quot;s. So self-absorbed and egotistical, it's" name="GEORGE" /><sd>like those hip musicians with their complicated shoes!</sd><sd>Kramer enters.</sd><char dialog="Well, I got gonorrhea." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="That seems about right." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="That's what they gave me." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="They? The Government?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="No, no. He's pretending he's got gonorrhea so med students can diagnose" name="JERRY" /><sd>it.</sd><char dialog="And it's a waste of my talent. It's just a little burning. Mickey, he" name="KRAMER" /><sd>got bacterial meningitis.</sd><char dialog="I guess there are no small diseases, only small actors." name="GEORGE" /><sd>The other three start laughing.</sd><char dialog="Alright that's it for me. Good night everybody." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="What was that?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Showmanship, George is trying to get out on a high note." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="See, showmanship. Maybe that's what my gonorrhea is missing." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Yes! Step into that spotlight and belt that gonorrhea out to the back" name="JERRY" /><sd>row.</sd><char dialog="Yes, yes I will! I'm gonna make people feel my gonorrhea, and feel the" name="KRAMER" /><sd>gonorrhea themselves.</sd><sd>Mt. Sanai Hospital. Kramer is on the table surrounded by med students.</sd><char dialog="And are you experiencing any discomfort?" name="STUDENT #1" /><char dialog="Just a little burning during urination." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Okay, any other pain?" name="STUDENT #1" /><char dialog="The haunting memories of lost love. May I? (signals to Mickey)" name="KRAMER" /><sd>Lights? (Mickey turns down the lights and Kramer lights a cigar) Our eyes met</sd><sd>across the crowded hat store. I, a customer, and she a coquettish haberdasher.</sd><sd>Oh, I pursued and she withdrew, then she pursued and I withdrew, and so we</sd><sd>danced. I burned for her, much like the burning during urination that I would</sd><sd>experience soon afterwards.</sd><char dialog="Gonorrhea?!" name="STUDENT #1" /><char dialog="Gonorrhea!" name="KRAMER" /><sd>The lab breaks out in spontaneous applause as Mickey turns up the lights and</sd><sd>Kramer takes a bow.</sd><sd>Jerry and George are back at Jerry's apartment. Jerry is checking his phone</sd><sd>messages.</sd><char dialog="One message. Hope it's not from you." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="&quot;Hey Jerry, it's me. Call me back.&quot;" name="ANSWERING MACHINE" /><char dialog="Sophie." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="She's still doing that?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Yep." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Alright, I'll tell you what you do. You call her back and give her the" name="GEORGE" /><sd>"it's me", heh? Pull the old switcheroo.</sd><char dialog="I think that's a &quot;what's good for the goose is good for the gander&quot;." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="What the hell is a gander, anyway?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="It's a goose that's had the old switcheroo pulled on it. Hi Sophie, it's me." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Hey Raef." name="SOPHIE" /><char dialog="She thinks it's someone named Raef." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Good, let her think it." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="So, what's going on?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Not a lot." name="SOPHIE" /><char dialog="Ask about you, ask about you." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="So, uh, how are things with Jerry?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Oh, I really like him but, well, I still haven't told him the tractor" name="SOPHIE" /><sd>story.</sd><char dialog="Right, right, the tractor story." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Are you sick, Raef? You sound kinda funny." name="SOPHIE" /><char dialog="I sound funny?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Abort! Abort!" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Yeah I better get to a doctor, bye. (Hangs up) That was close! What" name="JERRY" /><sd>drives me to take chances like that?</sd><char dialog="That was very real." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="She said there's some tractor story that she hasn't told me about." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Woah, back it up, back it up. Beep, beep, beep. Tractor story?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Beep, beep, beep? What are you doing?" name="JERRY" /><sd>Elaine and Puddy are at Puddy's apartment.</sd><char dialog="So where do you wanna eat?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Feels like an Arby's night." name="PUDDY" /><char dialog="Arby's. Beef and cheese and do you believe in god?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Yes." name="PUDDY" /><char dialog="Oh. So, you're pretty religious?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="That's right." name="PUDDY" /><char dialog="So is it a problem that I'm not really religious?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Not for me." name="PUDDY" /><char dialog="Why not?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="I'm not the one going to hell." name="PUDDY" /><sd>Jerry and George are at the coffee shop.</sd><char dialog="You know what I think? I bet she stole a tractor." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="No one's stealing a tractor, it's a five-mile-an-hour getaway. We're" name="JERRY" /><sd>dancing around the obvious, it's gotta be disfigurement.</sd><char dialog="Does she walk around holding a pen she never seems to need?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="No, she looks completely normal." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Oh. Okay, here it is, I got it. She lost her thumbs in a tractor" name="GEORGE" /><sd>accident and they grafted her big toes on. They do it every day.</sd><char dialog="You think she's got toes for thumbs?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="How's her handshake? A little firm, isn't it? Maybe a little too" name="GEORGE" /><sd>firm?</sd><char dialog="I don't know." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Hands a little smelly?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Why do I seek your counsel?" name="JERRY" /><sd>Elaine walks in.</sd><char dialog="Well I'm going to hell." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="That seems about right." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="According to Puddy." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Hey, have you heard the one about the guy in hell with the coffee and" name="JERRY" /><sd>the doughtnuts and--</sd><char dialog="I'm not in the mood." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="I'll have some coffee and a doughnut." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="What do you care? You don't believe in hell." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I know, but he does." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="So it's more of a relationship problem than the final destination of" name="JERRY" /><sd>your soul.</sd><char dialog="Well, relationships are very important to me." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Maybe you can strike one up with the prince of darkness as you burn for" name="JERRY" /><sd>all eternity.</sd><char dialog="And a slice of devil's food cake." name="GEORGE" /><sd>Kruger's office. George enters, seeing nobody but Mr. Kruger.</sd><char dialog="Hey. Where is everyone?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="They're all off the project. They were boring. George, you are my" name="MR. KRUGER" /><sd>main man.</sd><char dialog="I am?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I don't know what it is, I can't put my finger on it, but lately" name="MR. KRUGER" /><sd>you have just seemed 'on'. And you always leave me wanting more.</sd><char dialog="This is a huge project involving lots of numbers and papers and" name="GEORGE" /><sd>folders.</sd><char dialog="Ah, I'm not too worried about it. Let's get started." name="MR. KRUGER" /><char dialog="Okay." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="George? Check it out. (He begins to spin around in his chair)" name="MR. KRUGER" /><sd>Three times around, no feet.</sd><char dialog="And?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="All me." name="MR. KRUGER" /><sd>Kramer and Mickey are back at Mt. Sinai.</sd><char dialog="Alright, and here are you ailments for this week. By the way, Mr." name="DR. WEXLER" /><sd>Kramer, you were excellent.</sd><char dialog="Oh, thank you." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Cirrhosis of the liver with jaundice! Alright I get to wear make-up!" name="MICKEY" /><sd>What did you get?</sd><char dialog="Gonorrhea? Excuse me, I think there's been a mistake, see, I had" name="KRAMER" /><sd>gonorrhea last week.</sd><char dialog="Oh, it's no mistake. We loved what you did with it." name="DR. WEXLER" /><char dialog="I don't believe this, I'm being typecast." name="KRAMER" /><sd>Jerry and Sophie are at Jerry's playing chess.</sd><char dialog="I move my knight... here. Check." name="SOPHIE" /><char dialog="They should update these pieces, nobody rides horses anymore. Maybe" name="JERRY" /><sd>they should change it to a tractor.</sd><char dialog="Jerry, are you embarrassed that you're losing?" name="SOPHIE" /><char dialog="Losing? You know, yesterday I lost control of my car, almost bought the" name="JERRY" /><sd>farm.</sd><char dialog="Bought the farm?" name="SOPHIE" /><char dialog="Tractor!" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="This is an odd side of you, Jerry. I feel uncomfortable." name="SOPHIE" /><char dialog="Wait, don't go. Let's thumb wrestle." name="JERRY" /><sd>Sophie drops her purse and when she bends down to pick it up, Jerry nods</sd><sd>knowingly.</sd><sd>Jerry and George are at the coffee shop.</sd><char dialog="A scar?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="A big long scar where her leg would dangle when she's riding a...?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="A tractor." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I'm sure she's a little self-conscious and doesn't like to talk about" name="JERRY" /><sd>it.</sd><char dialog="I don't see why's she more self-conscious about that than her toe" name="GEORGE" /><sd>thumbs.</sd><char dialog="She doesn't have toe thumbs." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Well, if she keeps horsing around with that tractor--" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Alright. So how's the two-man operation at Kruger?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Two-man? It's all me. Kruger doesn't do anything; Disappears for" name="GEORGE" /><sd>hours at a time, gives me fake excuses. This afternoon I found him with sleep</sd><sd>creases on his face. The only reason I got out to get a bite today was that he</sd><sd>finally promised to buckle down and do some actual work. (turning around, George</sd><sd>sees Mr. Kruger at a booth eating a piece of cake) Oh, I don't believe this.</sd><sd>This is what I have to put up with, Jerry. (He walks over) Mr. Kruger? Who</sd><sd>said he was going to do some actual work today? Who?</sd><char dialog="I'm not too worried about it." name="MR. KRUGER" /><char dialog="Well I am. Couldn't you try to go through some of that stuff I put in" name="GEORGE" /><sd>your shoebox?</sd><char dialog="Alright, alright I'm going." name="MR. KRUGER" /><char dialog="Huh-ho! Have you ever seen anything like this?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Never." name="JERRY" /><sd>Elaine's hallway. The door opens, Puddy steps out in his bathrobe. There's a</sd><sd>newspaper in front of the door across from Elaine's.</sd><char dialog="Elaine, they forgot to deliver your paper today. Why don't you just" name="PUDDY" /><sd>grab that one.</sd><char dialog="'Cause that belongs to Mr. Potato Guy, that's his." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="C'mon, get it." name="PUDDY" /><char dialog="Well if you want it, you get it." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Sorry, thou shalt not steal." name="PUDDY" /><char dialog="Oh, but it's ok for me?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="What do you care, you know where you're going." name="PUDDY" /><char dialog="Alright, that is it! I can't live like this." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Nah." name="PUDDY" /><char dialog="C'mon." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Alright, what did I do?" name="PUDDY" /><char dialog="David, I'm going to hell! The worst place in the world! With devils" name="ELAINE" /><sd>and those caves and the ragged clothing! And the heat! My god, the heat! I</sd><sd>mean, what do you think about all that?</sd><char dialog="Gonna be rough." name="PUDDY" /><char dialog="Uh, you should be trying to save me!" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Don't boss me! This is why you're going to hell." name="PUDDY" /><char dialog="I am not going to hell and if you think I'm going to hell, you should" name="ELAINE" /><sd>care that I'm going to hell even though I am not.</sd><char dialog="You stole my Jesus fish, didn't you?" name="PUDDY" /><char dialog="Yeah, that's right!" name="ELAINE" /><sd>Elaine places her hands beside her head, index fingers raised as 'horns' and she</sd><sd>emits a gutteral growling sound.</sd><sd>Mt Sanai Hospital. The actors are gathered. Mickey is practicing his part.</sd><char dialog="Oh, my liver! Why did I drink all those years? Why did I look for" name="MICKEY" /><sd>love in a bottle?</sd><char dialog="Mr. Kramer? You're up." name="DR. WEXLER" /><sd>Kramer walks in, his face is noticably yellow.</sd><char dialog="Wait a minute. You are doing gonorrhea, aren't you?" name="MICKEY" /><char dialog="Well, we'll see." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="So, what seems to be bothering you today, Mr. Kramer?" name="STUDENT #2" /><char dialog="Well, I guess it started about twenty years ago when I got back from Viet Nam, and this was the" name="KRAMER" /><sd>only friend I had left.</sd><char dialog="Hey! That's my cirrhosis! He's stealing my cirrhosis! (he jumps" name="MICKEY" /><sd>Kramer) You wanna be sick? I'll make you sick.</sd><sd>They fall to the floor, wrestling.</sd><char dialog="Cirrhosis of the liver and PCP addiction?" name="STUDENT #2" /><sd>Elaine and Puddy have gone to see a priest, Father Curtis.</sd><char dialog="Let me see if I understand this. You're concerned that he isn't" name="FATHER CURTIS" /><sd>concerned that you're going to hell. And you feel that she's too bossy.</sd><char dialog="Yeah, that's right." name="ELAINE AND PUDDY" /><char dialog="Well, oftentimes in cases of inter-faith marriages, couples have" name="FATHER CURTIS" /><sd>difficulty--</sd><char dialog="Woah, woah, woah! No one's getting married here." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="You aren't?" name="FATHER CURTIS" /><char dialog="No." name="PUDDY" /><char dialog="We're just, you know, having a good time." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Oh, well then it's simple. You're both going to hell." name="FATHER CURTIS" /><char dialog="No way, this is bogus, man!" name="PUDDY" /><char dialog="Well, thank you father." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Oh, did you hear the one about the new guy in hell who's talkng" name="FATHER CURTIS" /><sd>to the devil by the coffee machine?</sd><char dialog="I'm really not in the mood, I'm going to hell." name="PUDDY" /><char dialog="Oh, lighten up. It'll only feel like an eternity." name="ELAINE" /><sd>Elaine makes the same 'fingers up' devil gesture as she did in her apartment and</sd><sd>Father Curtis joins in.</sd><sd>Jerry and Sophie ar at Jerry's apartment.</sd><char dialog="You know, Jerry, there's this thing that I haven't told you about." name="SOPHIE" /><sd>See, there was this tractor and, oh boy, this is really difficult.</sd><char dialog="Sophie, it's me. I know about the tractor story and I'm fine with it." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="How could you know?" name="SOPHIE" /><sd>Jerry (putting his finger to Sophie's lips, then to his own, then back to</sd><char dialog="Shh. Shh. Shh. It's not important. What's important is I'm not" name="SOPIE'S)" /><sd>gonna let a little thing like that ruin what could be a very long-term and</sd><sd>meaningful relationship.</sd><sd>Kramer and Mickey barge in, they're in the middle of an argument.</sd><char dialog="...I didn't say that, no." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="You gave me gonorrhea, you didn't even tell me!" name="MICKEY" /><char dialog="Well, I'm sorry. I gave you gonorrhea because I thought you'd have fun" name="KRAMER" /><sd>with it.</sd><char dialog="Hey, hey! I'm with someone." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Oh. Hello." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="No, I understand. This could be a tough thing to deal with. The" name="SOPHIE" /><sd>important thing is that you have a partner who's supportive.</sd><char dialog="You know? She's right." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Unfortunately, I didn't have a partner. I got gonorrhea from a" name="SOPHIE" /><sd>tractor.</sd><char dialog="You got gonorrhea from a tractor??
