It's like" name="GEORGE" /><sd>right there, you know, it's not even down a little hall or off in an alcove.</sd><sd>You understand? There's no... buffer zone. So, we start to fool around, and</sd><sd>it's the first time, and it's early in the going. And I begin to perceive this</sd><sd>impending... intestinal requirement, whose needs are going to surpass by great</sd><sd>lengths anything in the sexual realm. So I know I'm gonna have to stop. And as</sd><sd>this is happening I'm thinking, even if I can somehow manage to momentarily...</sd><sd>extricate myself from the proceedings and relieve this unstoppable force, I know</sd><sd>that that bathroom is not gonna provide me with the privacy that I know I'm</sd><sd>going to need...</sd><char dialog="This could only happen to you." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="So I finally stop and say, &quot;Tatiana, I hope you don't take this the" name="GEORGE" /><sd>wrong way, but I think it would be best if I left".</sd><char dialog="You said this to her after." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No. During." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Oh, boy." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Wow! So...?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="So I'm dressing and she's staring up at me, struggling to compute this" name="GEORGE" /><sd>unprecedented turn of events. I don't know what to say to reassure this woman,</sd><sd>and worst of all, I don't have the time to say it. The only excuse she might</sd><sd>possibly have accepted is if I told her I am in reality Batman, and I'm very</sd><sd>sorry, I just saw the Bat-Signal. It took me 3 days of phone calls to get her</sd><sd>to agree to see me again. Now she's waiting for me to call her, and she's</sd><sd>(gestures towards woman on phone) still on the phone.</sd><set>(Elaine comes over)</set><char dialog="I hate this place.

Remember," name="ELAINE" /><sd>it was such a treat to go and they serve you this different food that you never</sd><sd>saw before, and they put it in front of you, and it is such a delicious and</sd><sd>exciting adventure? And now I just feel like a big sweaty hog waiting for them</sd><sd>to fill up the trough.</sd><char dialog="She's off.

What in God's name is going on here?!" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="She's not there. She left.

Now she's gonna see him tomorrow and" name="JERRY" /><sd>tell him she saw me here tonight. He's gonna tell his wife, his wife's gonna</sd><sd>call my mother. Oh, this is bad, you don't know, the chain reaction of calls</sd><sd>this is gonna set off. New York, Long Island, Florida, it's like the Bermuda</sd><sd>Triangle. Unfortunately, nobody ever disappears. My uncle to my aunt, my aunt</sd><sd>to my mother, my mother to my uncle...</sd><char dialog="...My uncle to my cousin, my cousin to my sister, my sister to me." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="You should've just had dinner with your uncle tonight and gotten in" name="ELAINE" /><sd>over with. It's just a movie.</sd><char dialog="Just a movie?! You don't understand. This isn't 'Plans 1 through 8" name="JERRY" /><sd>from Outer Space', this is 'Plan 9', this is the one that worked.
