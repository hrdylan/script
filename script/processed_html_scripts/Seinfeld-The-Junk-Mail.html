This is Fragile Frankie Merman. When we were in" name="JERRY" /><sd>camp, if you upset him, he'd run out to the woods, dig a hole, and sit in it.</sd><char dialog="Well, I have an idea. Keep the van, and get a bumper sticker that" name="ELAINE" /><sd>says, 'If this vans a-rockin', don't come a-knockin'.'</sd><char dialog="Always helpful." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Oh, Georgie, what are you doing here?" name="ESTELLE" /><char dialog="Just dropped in for a visit.

There must be a truck backing up." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No, that's us." name="FRANKIE" /><char dialog="Great. You know, Frankie, I was wondering. What if I decided that" name="JERRY" /><sd>it's silly to drive a van, because, you know, I live in New York City.

They're puttin' it in my" name="JERRY" /><sd>box now.</sd><char dialog="Oh, that's it. They have gone too far. They keep pushing me, and" name="KRAMER" /><sd>pushing me.

Of course nobody needs mail. What do you" name="NEWMAN" /><sd>think, you're so clever for figuring that out? But you don't know the half of</sd><sd>what goes on here. So just walk away, Kramer. I beg of you.</sd><char dialog="Is everything all right here, Postal Employee Newman?" name="SUPERVISOR" /><char dialog="Yes, sir, I believe everything is all squared away. Isn't it, Mr." name="NEWMAN" /><sd>Kramer?</sd><char dialog="Oh, yeah.

I'm just not ready yet." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Aw, that's kind of sweet." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Ah, shut up, Jerry. My parents think they can ignore me. Heh heh." name="GEORGE" /><sd>Well, they better think again.</sd><char dialog="Oh, no. George, please. What are you going to do?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="You remember my cousin Rhisa? I'm gonna date her." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Mother of God." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="One little wink. She'll freak out, tell my parents. They'll be all" name="GEORGE" /><sd>over me. Who is this guy?</sd><char dialog="That guy Elaine's dating seems really familiar to me. I think he may" name="JERRY" /><sd>have been a comedian I worked with one time. Wait a minute, what is this?</sd><sd>On the TV, Jack is The Wiz, the spokesman for Nobody Beats the Wiz, chanting</sd><sd>Nobody beats me, because I'm the Wiz! I'm the Wiz!</sd><char dialog="That is the guy!" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Elaine's in love with the Wiz guy?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="No, she thinks she's in love with him. But she's just remembering" name="JERRY" /><sd>this old commercial.</sd><char dialog="That's pretty pathetic." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I know. They're not even related." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Uh... hey. I'm gonna get going." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Hey, have fun at the... family reunion. So, what do you know about" name="JERRY" /><sd>this Jack fellow?</sd><char dialog="Isn't he the best?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Yeah, nobody beats him. What kind of work does he do?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Oh, right now he's a fact checker for New York Magazine. It's not" name="ELAINE" /><sd>much, but it has a certain type of quiet dignity. this? On the TV, Jack is The Wiz, the spokesman for Nobody Beats the Wiz, chanting</sd><sd>Nobody beats me, because I'm the Wiz! I'm the Wiz!</sd><char dialog="Oh, no." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Oh, yes." name="JERRY" /><sd>come on buy.</sd><char dialog="Yeah, thanks." name="RHISA" /><char dialog="Sure. You know, Rhisa. I've always found you... very attractive." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="What?" name="RHISA" /><char dialog="I know it may sound shocking. But, I just can't stop myself from..." name="GEORGE" /><sd>wanting you.</sd><char dialog="You want to borrow money, right?" name="RHISA" /><char dialog="No, no. I-I just want us to be... together." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="All right." name="RHISA" /><char dialog="All right?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Let's go for it." name="RHISA" /><char dialog="Well... we could dance around it a little first." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Whoa! Whoa! Geez!" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="You know why I'm selling it. I hate it." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="How many miles?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Two." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="City or highway?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Look, do you really want to buy this thing, or what?" name="JERRY" /><sd>pressured. I'll walk away right now. Is this thing bent? I'm not paying for</sd><sd>that.</sd><char dialog="All right, just get out of here." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="All right, look. I'm going to be honest. I'm very interested in the" name="KRAMER" /><sd>van.</sd><char dialog="OK, fine. 'What do I have to do to put you in this van today?'" name="JERRY" /><sd>But it says right here, 'interesting trades considered'.</sd><char dialog="You put that in!" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="You want to trade me an undershirt?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No, I want to trade you screen legend Anthony Quinn's undershirt. He" name="KRAMER" /><sd>took this off to do sit-ups in the park and I nabbed it.</sd><char dialog="That's disgusting." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Well, it's my final offer." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="You dumped me for some idiotic TV pitchman." name="PUDDY" /><char dialog="Look, I'm sorry, Puddy. It-it was a mistake. So, let's just put it" name="ELAINE" /><sd>behind us, and we can continue like this never happened.</sd><char dialog="Gee, I don't know. What if we're out somewhere and you see the Maytag" name="PUDDY" /><sd>repairman.</sd><char dialog="You're not taking me back?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="That's right." name="PUDDY, LEAVING" /><char dialog="He's not idiotic. He's the Wiz. And nobody beats him. Nobody..." name="ELAINE" /><sd>on. Hey, mail blows. Fax it to a friend.</sd><char dialog="Why does this dummy have a bucket on its head?" name="WOMAN" /><char dialog="Because we're blind to their tyranny." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Then shouldn't you be wearing the bucket?" name="WOMAN" /><char dialog="Yeah. Move along, Betty." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Is this, uh, Jerry Seinfeld's van?" name="FRANKIE" /><char dialog="Well, not anymore. He traded it to me for some Hollywood" name="KRAMER" /><sd>memorabilia.</sd><char dialog="I'm, uh, I'm so stupid." name="FRANKIE" /><char dialog="What?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Yeah, nice to meet you." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="She's into it?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="She's leaving me dirty messages on my answering machine." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="So have your parents found out about it?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="She wants to keep it quiet. She... thinks we have a real future" name="GEORGE" /><sd>together.</sd><char dialog="Brave new world, alright." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Hey, how's the anti-mail campaign going?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Oh, it's fantastic. We were out in front of the post office today," name="KRAMER" /><sd>and not one person went in.</sd><char dialog="It's Sunday." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Why is the mailman wearing a bucket?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Huh? Well, it symbolizes our persecution." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Then... shouldn't you be wearing the bucket." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Hey, I want my van keys back." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Oh, well. I, uh, thought we made a deal for Quinn's t-shirt." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Are you insane? Give 'em to me." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No, I can't, I can't. See, I told Frank he could borrow it. Yeah, he" name="KRAMER" /><sd>wants to move some of George's stuff into storage.</sd><char dialog="Wait a minute? He's picking up the van tonight? This is perfect." name="GEORGE" /><sd>I'll drive Rhisa to someplace romantic. Then when my father slides the door</sd><sd>open, I'm in the van kissing his brother's daughter.</sd><char dialog="Oh, listen, Jerry. One of your friends came by and he was very upset" name="KRAMER" /><sd>that I had your wheels.</sd><char dialog="Oh, no, not Frankie." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Well, I didn't catch his name, but then he went running into the" name="KRAMER" /><sd>park.</sd><char dialog="Oh, no, the woods! The hole!" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Kramer, what the hell are you doing?" name="NEWMAN" /><char dialog="I know, I'm gonna switch the bucket to something else." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Not that!" name="NEWMAN" /><char dialog="What?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="You're in trouble, Kramer. I shouldn't even be talking to you, but" name="NEWMAN" /><sd>walking. Maybe on a crisp, autumn day just like today. When a mail truck will</sd><sd>slow beside you, and a door will open, and a mailman you know, maybe even</sd><sd>trust, will offer to give you a lift.</sd><char dialog="Are you through?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="No! And no one will ever see you again!" name="NEWMAN" /><char dialog="Are you through?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Yes. No, wait! OK, yes. in!" name="NEWMAN" /><char dialog="Oh, no, no, no. That's exactly how you said it was going down." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="There's another way it can go down, and it's going down right now!" name="NEWMAN" /><char dialog="No. You said a mailman I know, and you're a mailman I know!" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="I know you know, but you don't know what I know." name="NEWMAN" /><char dialog="Frankie! Frankie! Frankie! Frankie, is that you?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="My name is Edgar." name="HOLE DIGGER" /><char dialog="Have a nice night." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Thank you." name="HOLE DIGGER" /><sd>Frankie, digging a hole, talking to himself, and seeing Jerry's van pull up</sd><char dialog="Stupid... so stupid! Jerry?" name="NEAR HIM" /><char dialog="All right, George. I'm ready." name="RHISA" /><char dialog="Yeah, hold on. I'm, uh, I'm just trying to get a reading on my" name="GEORGE" /><sd>dashboard compass. Where are my parents?</sd><char dialog="Geor-gie... Seinfeld's van? Seinfeld's van? Seinfeld's van?! he saying?" name="RHISA" /><char dialog="I think he's saying 'Son of Sam'! Oh, my God!" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="No, they caught him." name="RHISA" /><char dialog="So I told him, 'Hit the road. I'm going back with Jack.'" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Elaine, that's the second piece of good news today." name="JACK" /><char dialog="Really, what was the first? again." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="What?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="I'm the Wiz! I'm the Wiz!" name="JACK, DANCING AROUND" /><char dialog="Well what, what about your fact-checking job?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Oh... here's a fact. Uh, I'm... the Wiz! I'm the Wiz" name="JACK, DANCING AROUND" /><sd>and noooobody beats me!</sd><sd>there.</sd><char dialog="You hate the van." name="FRANKIE" /><char dialog="But I'm keeping it. As much as I hate the idea of being a van guy," name="JERRY" /><sd>it's much better than hanging out here with the nocturnal dirt people.</sd><char dialog="So, can we go for a ride?" name="FRANKIE" /><char dialog="Yeah, let's just get out of here. with that?" name="JERRY" /><sd>Good. He left the door unlocked.</sd><char dialog="Why did Kramer have to park the van in the woods?" name="ESTELLE" /><char dialog="Isn't it obvious? There are no parking meters out here." name="FRANK" /><sd>mama!</sd><char dialog="Oh, my goodness. What have they done to you here?" name="POSTMASTER GENERAL" /><char dialog="Huh? Who are you?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Well, you can just call me Henry." name="POSTMASTER GENERAL" /><char dialog="Henry Atkins? The postmaster general?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Last time I checked." name="POSTMASTER GENERAL" /><char dialog="Henry... can I get out of here now?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Oh, oh. Sit a bit. Sit a bit. I mean, after all, I drove" name="POSTMASTER GENERAL" /><sd>all the way up here from D.C. just to talk to you.</sd><char dialog="Oh?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="I even had to cancel a round of golf with the secretary" name="POSTMASTER GENERAL" /><sd>of state. Do you like golf, Mr. Kramer?</sd><char dialog="Yeah." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Kramer, I've been, uh, reading some of your material" name="POSTMASTER GENERAL" /><sd>imagine. An army of men in wool pants running through the neighborhood</sd><sd>handing out pottery catalogs, door to door.</sd><char dialog="Yeah! Ha ha." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Well, it's my job. And I'm pretty damn serious about it." name="POSTMASTER GENERAL" /><sd>In addition to being a postmaster, I'm a general. And we both know, it's the</sd><sd>job of a general to, by God, get things done. So maybe you can understand why</sd><sd>I get a little irritated when someone calls me away from my golf.</sd><char dialog="I'm very, very sorry." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Sure, you're sorry. I think we got a stack of mail out" name="POSTMASTER GENERAL" /><sd>at the desk that belongs to you. Now, you want that mail, don't you Mr.</sd><sd>Kramer?</sd><char dialog="Sure do!
