Not bad, huh? Excuse me." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="You look ridiculous in that thing." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Is that so?

Robert's not exactly a *one* *woman* *man*, if" name="ELAINE" /><sd>you know what I mean. No sirree Bob. Sure, I mean in a lot of ways, he's a typical guy, he likes his</sd><sd>sports, but he counters that side with the side you see here tonight at the ballet, or the pleasure he gets in</sd><sd>watching Ms. Liza Minelli belt out a few choice numbers. It's those two halves of his personality that just</sd><sd>come together to make him the very special guy that he is.</sd><sd>Robert comes back.</sd><char dialog="Oh, hi honey." name="ELAINE" /><sd>Elaine grabs Robert and kisses him.</sd><sd>At Monk's.</sd><char dialog="Oh it was such a great night." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="And did they suspect anything?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No, I was a fantastic beard.

You're thinking conversion?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Well it did occur to me." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="You think you can get him to just change teams? He's not going to suddenly switch sides. Forget" name="JERRY" /><sd>about it.</sd><char dialog="Why? Is it irrevocable?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Because when you join that team it's not a whim. He likes his team. He's set with that team." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="We've got a good team." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Yeah, we do. We do have a good team." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Why can't he play for us?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="They're only comfortable with *their* equipment." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="We just got along *so* great." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Of course you did.

Okay, bye.</sd><sd>Kramer enters.

I don't have any tupperware." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I knew this was going to happen. I just made a delicious casserole, but now it won't keep because" name="KRAMER" /><sd>I have no Tupperware.</sd><char dialog="What about a plastic bag?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="You must be kidding." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="What is the difference?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="The patented burp, Jerry. It locks in freshness." name="KRAMER" /><sd>George enters.</sd><char dialog="So I spoke a little to your little friend Denise last night." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Oh yeah, you talked to her." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Yeah for two hours. She's nuts about you." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Yeah well we go way back." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Why didn't anything happen between you two?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Who's to say it didn't?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="So did you describe yourself to her over the phone?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yes I did." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="What did you say to her?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="What do you think I said?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I don't know." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I told her the truth." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="As you see it?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yes, as I see it." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Did you tell her about, uh, your little hat there?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="What hat?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="You know, you're little hair hat there." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Don't you think she could tell?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No, no, no she can't tell. It's a perfect match. Beautiful job." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Are you kidding? I could spot that bird's nest two blocks away." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="You only think that because you know me." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Have you noticed people staring at your head?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I noticed people staring at my head because they like what they see." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Well I think you should either take it off or tell her about it." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No he's not going to take it off. If he was going to go over there bald, I never would have" name="KRAMER" /><sd>introduced him.</sd><char dialog="Look, I guarantee she won't know." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Yeah that's it. All right, I'm going to go down to the precinct. I'm going to have lunch with Lou." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Oh, I'll split a cab with you." name="JERRY" /><sd>Walking down the street.</sd><char dialog="Hey I'm really sorry about the other day. Really sorry." name="KRAMER" /><sd>Kramer drops something into the man's cup.</sd><char dialog="Hey that's my coffee!" name="HOMELESS MAN" /><sd>At the police station</sd><char dialog="Hi Sarge." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Hi, I'm sorry I'm late. Some of our lineup decoys didn't show. Hey any of you guys want to be in" name="TIERNEY" /><sd>the lineup? Make a quick 50 bucks?</sd><char dialog="Sure. I will." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Perfect. Just go over there with officer Lampert." name="TIERNEY" /><sd>In the lineup room.</sd><sd>6 men stand there, one of which is Kramer.</sd><char dialog="All of you, turn to the left." name="OVER THE SPEAKER" /><sd>Everyone turns left. Kramer turns right.</sd><char dialog="The left." name="OVER THE SPEAKER" /><sd>Kramer turns left.</sd><char dialog="Now turn to the right." name="OVER THE SPEAKER" /><sd>Kramer turns to the right doing a "hokey pokey" dance.</sd><sd>At Monk's.</sd><char dialog="(thinking to himself) Oh my god, there she is. That's the face, just like the picture." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="George?" name="DENISE" /><char dialog="Yeah. Hi. It's great to meet you." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Likewise. Have you been waiting long?" name="DENISE" /><char dialog="No, no. I just got here. A few minutes ago." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Good, good." name="DENISE" /><char dialog="Well why don't you take off your hat and stay awhile." name="GEORGE" /><sd>Camera is on George. Denise takes off her hat. The camera is still on George. His expression changes to surprise.</sd><sd>At the police station.</sd><char dialog="What's that?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="A polygraph. It's what you civilians call a lie detector test." name="TIERNEY" /><char dialog="Oh. Let me ask you, when someone is lying, is it true that their pants are actually on fire?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="If I could tell you the famous faces that have been up here. A certain cast member of Melrose" name="TIERNEY" /><sd>Place.</sd><char dialog="Really." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Have you ever seen the show?" name="TIERNEY" /><char dialog="No." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="You can admit it Jerry. It's okay." name="TIERNEY" /><char dialog="I admit it. I don't watch it." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Hey Lou, maybe we should put him on the poly." name="TIERNEY" /><char dialog="The poly?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah. I think you've seen it." name="TIERNEY" /><sd>At Jerry's apartment.</sd><char dialog="Melrose Place?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Yes. Melrose Place." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I just didn't know you watched that." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Well I do." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I mean every time I mention it you never say anything or join in the conversation." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Well maybe I was a little embarrassed." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="You mean this whole time we could have been discussing Sydney and Michael and Jane..." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="And Billy and Jake and Allison, yes we could have discussed it." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Why? Why were you so embarrassed?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="The point is I'm going to be taking this lie detector test and that needle's going to be going wild." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="That is *so* stupid. Why don't you just confess?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="It's too stupid to confess. Look at what I'm confessing to." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="So what are you going to do?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="I don't know. Maybe I can beat the machine." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Oh, who do you think you are? Castanza?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Hey you know what? I have access to one of the most deceitful, duplicitous, deceptive minds of our" name="JERRY" /><sd>time. Who better to advise me?</sd><sd>Elaine takes a drink of something.</sd><char dialog="Oh god this tastes terrible." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Did you shake it up?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="You gotta shake it up." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No. I'm sick of shaking. You've got to shake everything." name="ELAINE" /><sd>Jerry picks up the bottle and shakes it gently.</sd><char dialog="Yeah, that's a real nuisance. This is killing me." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="So, I'm going out tonight with Robert and the boss and his wife." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="So tonight are you going to make the move?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah, I think I might." name="ELAINE" /><sd>George enters.</sd><char dialog="Hey there he is. So what happened? Could she detect it?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="That's an interesting question." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="How so?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="How so? I'll tell you how so. She's bald!" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="What do you mean bald?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="What do you think I mean bald? Bald. Bald bald." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="She's bald?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="She's bald." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Oh come on." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Oh come on? No come on. She took off her hat and there she was (waving his hand over his" name="GEORGE" /><sd>head) hello. It was like I was looking at myself in the mirror.</sd><char dialog="Well maybe she got a haircut or something." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Let me tell you something. No one walks into a beauty parlor and says &quot;Give me the Larry Fine.&quot;" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Women go bald?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah, I've heard of that. I mean they usually wear a wig." name="ELAINE" /><sd>Kramer enters.</sd><char dialog="Hey." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Hey." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="You fixed me up with a bald woman." name="GEORGE" /><sd>Kramer flinches.</sd><char dialog="Bald?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Yeah, that's right." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Do you see the irony here? You're rejecting somebody because they're bald." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="So?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="(puts her hands up to her mouth) You're bald!" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="No I'm not. I *was* bald." name="GEORGE" /><sd>Elaine grabs at the toupee, George dodges the grab.</sd><char dialog="Elaine." name="GEORGE" /><sd>Elaine grabs again and misses. George turns around and opens the door trying to get out. Elaine grabs the</sd><sd>toupee and runs to the window.</sd><char dialog="No, no, no Elaine." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="(shouting) I don't like this thing. And here's what I'm doing with it." name="ELAINE" /><sd>She tosses the toupee out the window.</sd><char dialog="Nooooo." name="GEORGE" /><sd>He runs to the window, and the blind comes down on his head.</sd><sd>Outside.</sd><sd>The homeless man is walking down the street and sees the toupee. He puts it on.</sd><sd>At Elaine's apartment.</sd><char dialog="Hahaha, why'd you start that fight with me?" name="ROBERT" /><char dialog="Well I figured that's what couples do." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="You almost convinced me we were a couple." name="ROBERT" /><char dialog="Well it was easy. Really." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Well good night, I'll call you tomorrow." name="ROBERT" /><char dialog="Oh, uh, wait a second. Would you like to come, upstairs?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Upstairs?" name="ROBERT" /><char dialog="Yeah. Upstairs?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Elaine..." name="ROBERT" /><char dialog="I was hoping you know, that you might be interested in... changing teams?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Changing teams?" name="ROBERT" /><char dialog="Have you ever thought about it?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="But I'm a starting shortstop." name="ROBERT" /><char dialog="Robert, we need a shortstop. *Real bad*." name="ELAINE" /><sd>At Monk's.</sd><char dialog="I tell you, when she threw that toupee out the window, it was the best thing that ever happened to" name="GEORGE" /><sd>me. I feel like my old self again. Totally inadequate, completely insecure, paranoid, neurotic, it's a</sd><sd>pleasure.</sd><char dialog="Good to have you back." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="And you know what else I've decided to do? I'm going to keep seeing the bald woman." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="She's as good as anybody else." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Her scalp was clean. She had a nice skull. There just wasn't a lot of hair on it." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Yeah you've had like a religious awakening. You're like a bald-again." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Going to need a little more coffee here." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="So George, how do I beat this lie detector?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I'm sorry, Jerry I can't help you." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Come on, you've got the gift. You're the only one that can help me." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Jerry, I can't. It's like saying to Pavorotti, &quot;Teach me to sing like you.&quot;" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="All right, well I've got to go take this test. I can't believe I'm doing this." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Jerry, just remember. It's not a lie... if you believe it." name="GEORGE" /><sd>Outside on the street. Jerry and Elaine walking toward each other.</sd><char dialog="Hey, I did it." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="What?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I turned him. He defected." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Get out! (pushes Elaine) How? How did you do that?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Because I'm a *woman*. (swiveling her hips) Ba-ba-ba-boom-chicka-boom-chicka-boom-boom-" name="ELAINE" /><sd>boom.</sd><char dialog="Elaine, do you know what you've done? You've give hope to every woman who's ever said &quot;Too" name="JERRY" /><sd>bad he's gay".</sd><char dialog="Well it's a lesson for the kids out there. Anything's possible. Jeromy, I have *hit* the jackpot." name="ELAINE" /><sd>The perfect man. Nothing but sex and shopping.</sd><sd>At the police station.</sd><sd>Kramer is in the lineup again. He and five other people walk into the room. They stand there for a few</sd><sd>moments. Kramer points with his eyes to the man on his left. He then tilts his head a few times to the man</sd><sd>on his left.</sd><sd>Elsewhere at the police station.</sd><sd>Jerry is hooked up to the polygraph.</sd><char dialog="What's your name?" name="LOU" /><char dialog="Jerry Seinfeld." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="What is your address?" name="LOU" /><char dialog="129 West 81st street." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Did Kimberly steal Jo's baby?" name="LOU" /><char dialog="I don't know." name="JERRY" /><sd>Camera shot on the polygraph.

And if so, did she enjoy it?" name="LOU" /><char dialog="I don't know." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Did Jane sleep with Michael again?" name="LOU" /><char dialog="(He hesitates) Yes! That stupid idiot. He left her for Kimberly, he slept with her sister. He tricked" name="JERRY" /><sd>her into giving him half her business, and then she goes ahead and sleeps with him again. I mean she's</sd><sd>crazy. How could she do something like that? Oh that Jane, she makes me so mad.</sd><sd>He picks up his coat and leaves.</sd><sd>At Jerry's apartment.</sd><char dialog="He went back? What do you mean he went back?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="He went back." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="I don't understand it. You were having such a great time, the sex, the shopping." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Well here's the thing. Being a woman, I only really have access to the, uh... equipment, what," name="ELAINE" /><sd>thirty, forty-five minutes a week. And that's on a good week. How can I be expected to have the same</sd><sd>expertise as people who *own* this equipment, and have access to it twenty-four hours a day, their entire</sd><sd>lives.</sd><char dialog="You can't. That's why they lose very few players." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah, I guess I never really stood a chance." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Well there's always a place for you, on our team." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah.

That makes me so happy. Elaine's proud of me Jerry." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="What is the matter?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="I got rejected by a bald woman. A bald woman rejected me. Heh, you like that one? A woman" name="GEORGE" /><sd>with no prospects and no *hair*, told me that I wasn't her type. Apparently *baldy* likes a slimmer guy.</sd><char dialog="Well I'll tell you what I think. I think she saw you with that piece off and was devastated. You" name="KRAMER" /><sd>blew it boy. You really blew it. And you had to ruin it for him. Didn't you?</sd><char dialog="I didn't ruin anything. He looked like an idiot.
