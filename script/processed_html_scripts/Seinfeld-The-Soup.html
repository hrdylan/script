Pick a theater." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Uh..we'll go to 3rd Avenue. So, can you come with us for lunch to the soup place?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No. You have a good lunch. But I'll meet you back here for the movie." name="SHEILA" /><char dialog="Hey." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Hey." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Hi Elaine." name="SHEILA" /><char dialog="Hi Sheila." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="All right, then.

I finally got a chance to go there the other day, and I tell you this, you will be stunned." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Stunned by soup?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="You can't eat this soup standing up, your knees buckle." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Huh. All right. Come on." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="There's only one caveat -- the guy who runs the place is a little temperamental, especially about the ordering procedure. He's secretly referred to as the Soup Nazi." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Why? What happens if you don't order right?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="He yells and you don't get your soup." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="What?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Just follow the ordering procedure and you will be fine." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="All right. All right. Let's - let's go over that again." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="All right. As you walk in the place move immediately to your right." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="What?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="The main thing is to keep the line moving." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="All right. So, you hold out your money, speak your soup in a loud, clear voice, step to the left and receive." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Right. It's very important not to embellish on your order.

Soup Nazi." name="BANIA" /><char dialog="Shhhhh! All right, Bania, I - I'm not letting you cut in line." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Why not?" name="BANIA" /><char dialog="Because if he catches us, we'll never be able to get soup again." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Okay. Okay." name="BANIA" /><char dialog="Medium turkey chili." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Medium crab bisque." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I didn't get any bread." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Just forget it.
