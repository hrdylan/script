Give me another chance." name="GEORGE" /><sd /><char dialog="[regretfully] Uh.. I know I'm gonna regret this." name="KRAMER" /><sd>[sigh] All right.</sd><sd /><char dialog="[grateful, relieved] Thank you!" name="GEORGE" /><sd>I'm gonna make you both so happy!</sd><sd /><char dialog="All right, all right, I'll see ya later. [shuts door]" name="KRAMER" /><sd /><char dialog="[delighted!] Woooo!" name="GEORGE" /><sd>[The next day, ELAINE's passing by the door of PETERMAN's office.]</sd><sd /><char dialog="Elaine! Where's Susie? I want her to head up our new Fingerless Glove Division." name="PETERMAN" /><sd /><char dialog="[quiet] Oh, but I thought I was in line for that assignment." name="ELAINE" /><sd /><char dialog="Mmmmm--nah." name="PETERMAN" /><sd /><char dialog="All right, then, I was gonna wait, to tell ya this, but.. last night, Susie.." name="ELAINE" /><sd>[difficult subject, quiet] she took her own Life..</sd><sd>[PETERMAN grasps this, weepy in disappointment, "Oh!". ELAINE comforts him.]</sd><sd>[Allison's apartment. KRAMER knocks and ALLISON gets it.]</sd><sd /><char dialog="[happy, enthused] We're takin' George back--" name="KRAMER" /><sd /><char dialog="What?!" name="ALLISON" /><sd /><char dialog="He's gonna make us very happy." name="KRAMER" /><sd>[ALLISON looks doubtful/disappointed.]</sd><sd>[Inside, there are chairs lined up in rows, most are filled. There's a podium on a riser, flowers everywhere.]</sd><sd /><char dialog="[quiet] Look at this turnout." name="ELAINE" /><sd /><char dialog="[quiet] Where did Susie find the time to meet all these people.." name="JERRY" /><sd /><char dialog="[irritated] Your funeral's not gonna come close to this." name="ELAINE" /><sd>[They've found seats together in the row in front of PEGGY, who looks like she's seeing a ghost!]</sd><sd /><char dialog="[to herself] Oh my god!" name="PEGGY" /><sd>[quiet] Susie?</sd><sd /><char dialog="[quiet] Oh, oh--ho--I'm not Susie.. I'm Elaine." name="ELAINE" /><sd /><char dialog="But I've been calling you Susie." name="PEGGY" /><sd /><char dialog="Oh! Hadn't noticed!" name="ELAINE" /><sd>Excuse me. [she's going to the podium]</sd><sd /><char dialog="I guess I never met Susie." name="PEGGY" /><sd /><char dialog="[privately amused] Suze? I actually had a little thing with her for a while." name="JERRY" /><sd>[indicating ELAINE] Her too.</sd><sd>[ELAINE's now at the podium.]</sd><sd /><char dialog="What can you say about a girl like Susie? [she doesn't know..]" name="ELAINE" /><sd>[Meanwhile, out in the parking lot, PETERMAN arrives in his little red convertible (top down), distracted with</sd><sd>disappointment/sadness. He parks behind Jerry's car and bumps it. Jerry's trunk has unlatched but not popped open big.</sd><sd>PETERMAN doesn't notice anything and goes in. Shortly after he passes, MIKE comes out of the trunk, squinting in the</sd><sd>daylight, his body is sore, he shuts the trunk.</sd><sd>Nearby, there's a small announcement sign (with stick-in white letters):</sd><sd /><char dialog="" name="TODAY'S" /><char dialog="" name="SCHEDULE" /><char dialog="" name="LIEBERMAN BARMITZVAH" /><sd /><char dialog="" name="SUSIE'S MEMORIAL" /><char dialog="" name="--&gt;" /><sd /><char dialog="" name="(APPROXIMATION)" /><sd>MIKE sees it and is alarmed! He's still disoriented but hobbles away with determination!]</sd><sd>[Tavern on the Green, at dusk. The Pinstripe Ball is starting. The walls there are mahogany, and there are short, decorative</sd><sd>columns with flowers on top of them. Everyone is in tuxedos and gowns, and the music is mellow and quiet. GEORGE is</sd><sd>waiting in a tux for Allison, but KRAMER arrives in his rather tight tux. They talk quietly.]</sd><sd /><char dialog="Hey." name="KRAMER" /><sd /><char dialog="Where's uh, where's Allison.." name="GEORGE" /><sd /><char dialog="Oh, Allison, she didn't want to come." name="KRAMER" /><sd /><char dialog="But you took me back." name="GEORGE" /><sd /><char dialog="Well, yeah, I did, but she's a tough nut." name="KRAMER" /><sd>How d'ya like the tuxedo. It's a rental but I've had it for fifteen years.</sd><sd>All right, eh. [heading in]</sd><sd /><char dialog="Where are you goin'.." name="GEORGE" /><sd /><char dialog="The Ball, silly." name="KRAMER" /><sd /><char dialog="[afraid not] No no, no no no. You're not goin' in there." name="GEORGE" /><sd /><char dialog="George. I thought you were gonna Change." name="KRAMER" /><sd /><char dialog="[impatient] For her. Not for you." name="GEORGE" /><sd /><char dialog="[light admonishing, under breath] Let's just try, an' have a nice time for once, an' we'll talk about this when we get home.." name="KRAMER" /><sd>[They start struggling quietly, KRAMER's trying to just walk by, and GEORGE is trying to restrain him without attracting too</sd><sd>much attention.]</sd><sd /><char dialog="All right, look--wait--wait--Krama--wait, wait a minute, you are not. You are not goin' in. Ah-ahhh!" name="GEORGE" /><sd>[GEORGE had KRAMER in a slightly spinning hold--by holding the back of KRAMER's tux--but the material tore away, and</sd><sd>this sent KRAMER spinning into the room with the back torn off his tux! Strangely, this is well-received by WILHELM!]</sd><sd /><char dialog="Wow! What an, Entrance!" name="WILHELM" /><sd>[friendly, to GEORGE] And eh, who might this be?</sd><sd /><char dialog="Oh, I'm with him." name="KRAMER" /><sd /><char dialog="Oh. Ah-ha.." name="WILHELM" /><sd>[Meanwhile at the Memorial, ELAINE is still at the podium. She has her chin in her hand while talking, weary of making up</sd><sd>things and of acting mournful.]</sd><sd /><char dialog="And.. also, much like me, Susie hated going to the, Market." name="ELAINE" /><sd /><char dialog="Elaine! May I say a few words." name="PETERMAN" /><sd /><char dialog="Oh, god, yes, Mr. Peterman. [steps down]" name="ELAINE" /><sd /><char dialog="[steps up to the podium, refreshed] Ahhh." name="PETERMAN" /><sd>I don't think I'll ever be able to forget Susie--ahhh. And most of all, I will never, forget that one night. Working late on the</sd><sd>catalogue. Juuust the two of us. And we surrendered to temptation.</sd><sd>And it was Pretty Good.</sd><sd /><char dialog="[proud to PEGGY, under his breath] Yeah, but he didn't sleep with both of 'em. [winks]" name="JERRY" /><sd>[ELAINE (who has returned to her seat) catches JERRY's eye. Though we don't see her face, his drops and he sobers it up.]</sd><sd /><char dialog="But Iiii never heard her Cries for Help. [sighs]" name="PETERMAN" /><sd>An' nowww.. Susie is gone.</sd><sd /><char dialog="[running in, still hoarse, desperate!] Hold on! Hol--on!" name="MIKE" /><sd>Susie didn't commit suicide!</sd><sd>[rushes up to podium!] She was Murdered, by Jerry, Sein-feld!</sd><sd>[While MIKE's pointing at JERRY and everyone's looking, JERRY looks back at PEGGY again.]</sd><sd /><char dialog="[smugly, under-his-breath] Not only that, I broke his thumbs." name="JERRY" /><sd>[PEGGY and ELAINE look at him strangely as he grins during such an inappropriate moment.]</sd><sd>[After dark, PETERMAN and ELAINE are sitting and talking in his office.]</sd><sd /><char dialog="Elaine? Guess what. I've decided to Form a Charitable Foundation, in Susie's honor. And as Susie's best friend, I want you to" name="PETERMAN" /><sd>be involved.</sd><sd /><char dialog="Mr. Peterman.." name="ELAINE" /><sd>[leaning forward, whispering] I'm Susie.. She's me..</sd><sd /><char dialog="[leans forward, whispers carefully] I feel the same way." name="PETERMAN" /><sd>[announcing] And that's why this foundation will meet around Your Schedule. Nights! Weekends! Every, Free Moment you</sd><sd>have. [leaving, pats her shoulders confidently]</sd><sd /><char dialog="[looks up, screaming in frustration!] Suuuuuuuuuuze!" name="ELAINE" /><sd>[(During her screaming up to the air, the camera was over her, looking down, and turning around and around, just like it had</sd><sd>when GEORGE found out that he was going to be running a foundation in honor of Susan!)]</sd><sd /><char dialog="" name="THE END" /></root>
