You should see the bathroom they gave me!" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="How can you do this?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Jerry, let's face it, I've always been handicapped. I'm just now getting the recognition for it. Name one thing I have that puts me in a position of advantage. Huh? There was a guy that worked at the Yankees-- no arms! He got more work done than I did, made more money, had a wife, a family, drove a better car than I did." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="He drove a car with no arms?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Alright I made up the part about the car, but the rest is true.

With "Morning Train"</sd><sd>by Sheena Easton as the background, George rides up the stairs on a rail, is</sd><sd>carried through the hall by a woman, is caught 'fencing' with his cane and fakes</sd><sd>a lame knee, and trips a co-worker with the cane handle and gets laughs from</sd><sd>everyone, including the man he tripped.</sd><sd>Jerry walks into his apartment sniffing the air, followed closely by Newman.</sd><char dialog="Someone's cooking." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Hello, Jerry." name="NEWMAN" /><char dialog="Hello, Newman." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="You know, old friend, sometimes I ponder this silly gulf between us and I say, &quot;Why?&quot; Are we really so different. For what is--" name="NEWMAN" /><char dialog="I'm not the one doing the cooking, Newman." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Damn you Seinfeld. You useless pustule. Um, somebody's got something on the griddle. Maybe it's Kramer." name="NEWMAN" /><char dialog="No, he's up on the roof getting some sun with the butter - pause - Oh no!" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Butter?" name="NEWMAN" /><sd>Back to the airplane. Elaine and Puddy indirectly attack each other.</sd><char dialog="-Fimty kroner." name="PASSENGER" /><char dialog="You know my last boyfriend, he had a real kroner" name="ELAINE" /><sd>comprehension problem. No what I mean? A real cement head.</sd><sd>Puddy and the woman across the aisle share a laugh.</sd><char dialog="David, you are so funny." name="WOMAN" /><char dialog="Yeah, I know." name="PUDDY" /><char dialog="What are you doing?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="It's a long flight, Elaine. I had to get on with my life." name="PUDDY" /><char dialog="By making time with some floozy across the aisle?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Yeah, that's right. Well, what's going on over there with you and, uh, vegetable lasagna?" name="PUDDY" /><char dialog="This guy? He's an idiot. He doesn't mean anything to me." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="I can hear you." name="PASSENGER" /><char dialog="Well, she doesn't mean anything to me either. If it were up to me, we'd still be together." name="PUDDY" /><char dialog="Well maybe I feel the same way." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Ok." name="PUDDY" /><char dialog="Ok, so now what?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Let's make out." name="PUDDY" /><sd>Roof of Jerry and Kramer's building, very bright and sunny. Kramer is decked out shirtless</sd><sd>and sleeping on a lawn chair, and he's bright red.</sd><char dialog="Kramer!" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Oh, man. I think I cooked myself." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Look at your skin." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Stick a fork in me, Jerry. I'm done." name="KRAMER" /><sd>Jerry's apartment, Kramer walks in.</sd><char dialog="I'm fried." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Technically, you're saut&#233;ed. So, what are you doing for that?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Well, I just gotta keep my skin moist so I don't dry out." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Is that what the doctor said?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No, I read an article in Bon Appetite magazine." name="KRAMER" /><sd>Kramer leaves, George enters, limping.</sd><char dialog="Hmm. Game hen?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Kind of. Nice limp, you're bringing your work home with you?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No, I fake limp on my right. This is a real limp because I sprained my ankle." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="What happened?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Well, I was buttering myself up for a nice shave --" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Oh no, not you too?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I must have dripped some on the floor and I slipped and..." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="You know what's good for that? Relish." name="JERRY" /><sd>Phone rings, Jerry answers.</sd><char dialog="Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. What? No. No! No! No!! No!!!" name="JERRY" /><sd>Thank you. (Hangs up.) I don't believe this. They've added Bania to the network showcase and he's going on right after me.</sd><char dialog="So what, he's got a couple of good jokes." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Like what, Ovaltine? Why do dogs drink out of the toilet? Shopping" name="JERRY" /><sd>carts with one bad wheel?</sd><char dialog="That's true, that always happens to me." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="You think that's funny?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I don't know, I like stuff you don't have to think about too much." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="You like Bania's act. You're a closet Bania fan!" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="maybe I am." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Oh, I'm gonna puke." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Puke! That's a funny word. Puke. (laughing) puke! Don't have to" name="GEORGE" /><sd>think about that.</sd><sd>Elaine and Puddy on the plane.</sd><char dialog="I can't believe we broke up like that." name="ELAINE" /><sd>Elaine starts reading, Puddy stares off into space.</sd><char dialog="Do you want something to read?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Nah." name="PUDDY" /><char dialog="Well, are you going to take a nap or" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="" name="--" /><char dialog="Nah." name="PUDDY" /><char dialog="You're just going to sit there staring at the back of a seat?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Yeah." name="PUDDY" /><sd>Elaine tries to read but cannot concentrate.</sd><char dialog="That's it! I cannot take this! I mean, look at this, nothing has" name="ELAINE" /><sd>changed. We're back together two hours, we're having the same problems we had</sd><sd>12 hours ago.</sd><char dialog="Tell me about it, I don't know why I ever took you back." name="PUDDY" /><char dialog="Please! I took you back. You know it, I know it, vegetable lasagna" name="ELAINE" /><sd>here knows it.</sd><char dialog="I don't want to get involved." name="VEGETABLE LASAGNA" /><char dialog="Ugh, I hope a giant mountain rises out of the ocean and we just ram" name="ELAINE" /><sd>right into it and end this whole thing!</sd><char dialog="Oh god." name="VEGETABLE LASAGNA" /><sd>Elaine then slams her seat back several times into the legs of the passenger</sd><sd>seated behind her.</sd><char dialog="Ow! Ow!!" name="PASSENGER" /><sd>Kramer's apartment, Kramer is in the hot tub, Newman is seated beside it,</sd><sd>reading "Alive"</sd><char dialog="How much longer you gonna be, I'm starving here." name="NEWMAN" /><char dialog="Just a few more squirts. Cause I gotta stay juicy." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="The smell. It's still with you, huh?" name="NEWMAN" /><char dialog="Yeah, it's baked on it. Put some butter in. Stir it up so it melts." name="KRAMER" /><sd>Newman stirs the hot tub with a lacrosse stick, licking his lips and working</sd><sd>himself up.</sd><char dialog="Ahh, now I'm simmering." name="KRAMER" /><sd>Newman drops the stick and runs out.</sd><char dialog="I'll meet you at the coffee shop." name="NEWMAN" /><sd>George and Mr. Thomassoulo at Play Now.</sd><char dialog="Good morning, George. Is something wrong with your other leg?" name="MR. THOMASSOULO" /><char dialog="Oh, no, that's just the old handicap acting up." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="But your cane's on the wrong side." name="MR. THOMASSOULO" /><char dialog="That's just because we're standing on opposite sides. See, when we" name="GEORGE" /><sd>met, I was over there and you were over here so the image was reversed, like in</sd><sd>the mirror.</sd><sd>They walk over to a mirrored wall.</sd><char dialog="See? This looks right to you, doesn't it?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Uh, yeah, I guess." name="MR. THOMASSOULO" /><char dialog="But, see here." name="GEORGE" /><sd>Right. Wrong. Right. Wrong. Right.

THOMASSOULO" /><sd>what's going on here.</sd><sd>Jerry's apartment, there's a beeping sound coming from the hall. Jerry opens</sd><sd>the door, George rolls in on a Rascal scooter.</sd><char dialog="Well, you're not gonna believe what happened." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="You mugged Stephen Hawking?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Play Now thinks I got problems in both legs. My own personal Rascal," name="GEORGE" /><sd>Jerry. On the house.</sd><sd>George rides around the apartment.</sd><char dialog="Well it must be comforting to know you'll be going straight to hell at" name="JERRY" /><sd>no more than three miles an hour.</sd><sd>Jerry's phone rings, he answers it.</sd><char dialog="Hello?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Jerry." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Hey, Lainie, how's the trip going?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Awful. This trip was a *huge* mistake. Huge!" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Please don't shout.

Kramer. Butter. Kramer." name="NEWMAN" /><sd>The waitress brings a roasted turkey out on a tray. Newman hallucinates</sd><sd>Kramer's head on the turkey.</sd><char dialog="Hey buddy." name="KRAMER/TURKEY" /><sd>Newman screams and runs out of Monks.</sd><sd>Jerry and Kramer in the back room of a comedy club</sd><char dialog="What are you doing?

I bombed!" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No, you had some good stuff. The cancer bit? It was edgy, it was not" name="KRAMER" /><sd>my sort of thing but some of those people out there, they really liked it.</sd><char dialog="Like who?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Like that guy who yelled out." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="He had cancer!" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="And laughter is the best medicine." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Hey, sorry Kenny.
