<root><char dialog="Written by Larry David &amp; Jerry Seinfeld" name="THE PHONE MESSAGE" /><set>(Comedy club)</set><sd>The bad thing about television is that everybody you see on television is</sd><sd>doing something better than what you're doing. Did you ever see anybody on TV</sd><sd>like just sliding off the front of the sofa with potato chip crumbs on their</sd><sd>commercial people - where do they summon this enthusiasm? Have you seen them?</sd><sd>"We have soda, we have soda, we have soda", jumping, laughing, flying through</sd><sd>the air - it's a can of soda. Have you ever been standing there and you're</sd><sd>watching TV and you're drinking the exact same product that they're advertising</sd><sd>right there on TV, and it's like, you know, they're spiking volleyballs,</sd><sd>jetskiing, girls in bikinis and I'm standing there - "Maybe I'm putting too much</sd><sd>ice in mine."</sd><char dialog="So then, as we were leaving, we were just kind of standing there," name="GEORGE" /><sd>and she was sort of smiling at me, and I wasn't sure if she wanted me to ask her</sd><sd>out, because when women smile at me I don't know what it means. Sometimes I</sd><sd>interpret it like they're Psychotic or something and I don't know if I'm</sd><sd>supposed to smile back, I don't know what to do. So I just stood there like -</sd><sd>remember how Quayle looked when Benson gave him that Kennedy line? - that's what</sd><sd>I looked like.</sd><char dialog="So you didn't ask?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No, I froze." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="(Points to counter) Counter." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Oh yeah. So wait, wait. A half-hour later I'm back in the office," name="GEORGE" /><sd>I tell Lloyd the whole story. He says "So why don't you call her". I says "I</sd><sd>can't." I couldn't, I couldn't do it right then. For me to ask a woman out I</sd><sd>gotta get into a mental state like the karate guys before they break the bricks.</sd><sd>So Lloyd calls me a wuss.</sd><char dialog="He said wuss?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah. Anyway, he shamed me into it." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="So you called. (They sit at counter)" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Right. And, and to cover my nervousness I started eating an apple," name="GEORGE" /><sd>because I think if they hear you chewing on the other end of the phone, it</sd><sd>makes you sound casual.</sd><char dialog="Yeah, like a farm boy." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Right. So I call her up, I tell her it's me, she gives me an" name="GEORGE" /><sd>enthusiastic 'Hi!'</sd><char dialog="Wow. Enthusiastic 'Hi!', that's beautiful." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Oh, I don't get the enthusiastic 'Hi!', I'm outta there." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Alright, so you're chewing your apple, you got your enthusiastic" name="JERRY" /><sd>'Hi!' Go ahead.</sd><char dialog="So, we're talking, and I don't like to go too long before I ask them" name="GEORGE" /><sd>out, I wanna get it over with right away, so I just blurt out "What are you</sd><sd>doing Saturday night?"</sd><char dialog="And?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="She bought." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Great day in the morning." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Then I got off the phone right away." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Sure, it's like robbing a bank: you don't loiter around in front of" name="JERRY" /><sd>the teller holding that big bag of money. You come in, you hit and get out.</sd><char dialog="It's amazing: we, we both have dates on the same night. I can't" name="GEORGE" /><sd>remember the last time that happened.</sd><sd>George's car, parked outside apartment building, night. George and his date</sd><char dialog="" name="CAROL" /><char dialog="I can't stand doing laundry. That's why I have forty pairs of" name="GEORGE" /><sd>underwear.</sd><char dialog="You do not." name="CAROL" /><char dialog="Absolutely.

I could sit on a porch and</sd><sd>wrestle around, and maybe even be part of a real bull session.</sd><char dialog="Hey, I know guys like that. To me the dialogue rings true." name="DONNA" /><char dialog="(Shrugs. Pause) Even if the dialogue did ring true. Even if" name="JERRY" /><sd>somehow somewhere men actually talk like that, what does that have to do with</sd><sd>the pants? Doesn't that bother you?</sd><char dialog="(Increasingly annoyed) That's the idea. That's what's clever about" name="DONNA" /><sd>it, that they're not talking about the pants.</sd><char dialog="But they're talking about nothing." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="That's the point." name="DONNA" /><char dialog="I know the point." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No one is telling you to like it." name="DONNA" /><char dialog="I mean, all those quick shots of the pants, just pants, pants," name="JERRY" /><sd>pants, pants, pants, pants, pants. What is that supposed to be?</sd><set>(Donna sighs, leans away from Jerry, looks at watch)</set><char dialog="" name="JERRY MONOLOGUE" /><sd>What's brutal about the date is the scrutiny that you put each other</sd><sd>through. Because whenever you think about this person in terms of the future,</sd><sd>you have to magnify everything about them. You know, like the guy'll be like</sd><sd>'I don't think her eyebrows are even. Could I look at uneven eyebrows for the</sd><sd>rest of my life?' And of course the woman's looking at the guy, thinking 'What</sd><sd>is he looking at? Do I want somebody looking at me like this for the rest of my</sd><sd>life?'</sd><char dialog="I'm supposed to see her again on Thursday, but can I go out with" name="JERRY" /><sd>someone who actually likes this commercial?</sd><char dialog="I once broke up with a guy because he didn't keep his bathroom clean" name="ELAINE" /><sd>enough.</sd><char dialog="No kidding.
