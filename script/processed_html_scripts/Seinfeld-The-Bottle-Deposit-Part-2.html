We're losing him." name="KRAMER" /><sd>The Saab easily outpaces the truck and accelerates away. The truck</sd><sd>staggers to a halt, giving out a death rattle. A cloud of steam and smoke erupts from</sd><sd>under the hood.</sd><char dialog="I think we lost him." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="(disappointment) Dammit!" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="(quietly) Can you stop and pick up those clubs Kramer?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="(subdued) Yeah, yeah, I'll get 'em." name="KRAMER" /><sd>Jerry hangs up.</sd><set>(Country)</set><sd>Kramer climbs out of the truck and looks back down the road. He kicks</sd><sd>the deflated tyre. Coming to the front of the truck, he picks a club off</sd><sd>the front bumper and pulls the broken shaft of another out of the radiator</sd><sd>grille.</sd><sd>Kramer walks along the road with the bent and broken clubs. He comes</sd><sd>upon the bag and transfers the clubs into it. Slinging it over his shoulder, he</sd><sd>continues on his way, picking up more battered golf clubs as he goes.</sd><set>(Farm)</set><sd>Newman, the farmer and the farmer's daughter sit round the kitchen</sd><sd>table.

It's very good.</sd><sd>The farmer's daughter is staring at Newman and toying with her fork,</sd><sd>touching it to her lips and teeth. (It's difficult to be arousing with cutlery, but</sd><sd>she's giving it a pretty good shot.) Newman notices this and tries to take a</sd><sd>nonchalant sip from a glass, but it goes down the wrong way and he</sd><sd>splutters.</sd><char dialog="That cider too strong for you?" name="FARMER" /><char dialog="No, no. I love strong cider.

His free hand is</sd><sd>holding the waistband of his trousers. In the background are a couple of</sd><sd>inmates and visitors, and an orderly.

Just tell 'em</sd><sd>what we talked about, how I, how I, I didn't do the project.</sd><sd>Deena spots George as she makes her way out of the room.</sd><char dialog="George?" name="DEENA" /><sd>George looks like his salvation has arrived. He hangs up the phone.</sd><char dialog="I see you're finally getting some help." name="DEENA" /><char dialog="Aw, hoh, oh Deena, thank God. (he hugs Deena) Thank God you're" name="GEORGE" /><sd>here. Listen, you gotta help me. You gotta tell these people that I'm okay.</sd><sd>You know that I don't belong in here.</sd><char dialog="George, this is the best thing for you.

No, no!" name="GEORGE" /><sd>As he tries to follow Deena, the orderly grabs hold of him and</sd><sd>restrains him.</sd><char dialog="Deena! Deena, wait a... Deena, help!" name="GEORGE" /><sd>George is almost in tears and hops from foot to foot in frustration as</sd><sd>the orderly holds him. Pop Lazzari wanders over.</sd><char dialog="Is that little Georgie C? How's the folks? You still got that nice" name="POP" /><sd>little car?</sd><set>(Countryside)</set><sd>Kramer approaches a familiar farmhouse. As he mounts the steps up to</sd><sd>the porch, a commotion erupts inside the place. A gunshot rings out and the</sd><sd>farmer's daughter screams. Kramer flinches. The farmer can be heard yelling</sd><sd>angrily. The door is flung open and Newman runs out pulling up his trousers.</sd><char dialog="(screaming in panic) Aaah!! Aaah!" name="NEWMAN" /><char dialog="What you doing?!" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="(pushing past Kramer) Kramer, help me! Help me!" name="NEWMAN" /><sd>Newman sets off running. From the door of the farmhouse comes the</sd><sd>farmer, armed with a shotgun, closely followed by his daughter, whose shirt is undone</sd><sd>and hair is dishevelled.</sd><char dialog="(takes one look and sets off after Newman) Jeez!" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="(taking aim) I told you to keep away from my daughter!" name="FARMER" /><sd>As Kramer and Newman reach the edge of the crops, the farmer fires a</sd><sd>shot. Both Newman and Kramer leap in the air and run into the cover of the crop.</sd><sd>Before the farmer can fire again, his daughter pushes the barrel of the shotgun</sd><sd>downward, spoiling his aim.</sd><char dialog="No daddy, you'll hurt him! I love him! (waving after Newman) Goodbye Norman, goodbye." name="SUSIE" /><set>(Elaine's Office)</set><sd>Elaine is sitting with her head in her hands. Peterman enters at a rush.</sd><char dialog="(excited) Elaine! You found the clubs. That's wonderful news. Where are they?" name="PETERMAN" /><char dialog="(not the soul of happiness) Yep. Lemme get 'em for you, Mr Peterman." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Oh, I'll be inaugrating them this weekend, with none other than Ethel Kennedy. A woman whose triumph in the face of tragedy is exceeded only by her proclivity to procreate." name="PETERMAN" /><sd>Elaine puts the bag of clubs down beside Peterman. The clubs are, of course, wrecked. Elaine looks like she's expecting a poor reaction. Peterman picks up a club or two, staring in disbelief at the twisted metal.</sd><char dialog="The uh, the letter of, authenticity's in the side pocket there." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Elaine. I never knew Kennedy had such a temper." name="PETERMAN" /><char dialog="(spotting a chance to keep her job) Oh. Oh yeah. The only thing worse was his slice.
