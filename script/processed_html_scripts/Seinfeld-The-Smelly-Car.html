I" name="JERRY" /><sd>figure by this time, the odour molecules have had at least twelve</sd><sd>hours to de-smellify.

Because I stink! Jerry, he thinks</sd><char dialog="" name="I" /><sd>have B.O.! Me!</sd><char dialog="What happened?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="What happened? My car *stinks* is what happened.

B.O.?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Yeah." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="This is *unbelievable* B.O." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I know... I was at the car wash this morning and the guy told me" name="JERRY" /><sd>in his 38 years in the business, he's never smelled anything like</sd><sd>it.</sd><char dialog="So, let me ask you. Do you think I could have done this?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="No, no. It's the valet guy." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No, no, I mean, driving Susan to lesbianism." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Oh... No, that's ridiculous." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="What if her experience with me *drove* her to it?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Suicide, maybe, not lesbianism." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="The woman she's &quot;lesbianing&quot; with?

It's *B*.B.O.!" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="There should be a B.O. squad that patrols the city like a &quot;Smell" name="JERRY" /><sd>Gestapo". To sniff 'em out, strip 'em down, and wash them with a</sd><sd>big, soapy brush...</sd><char dialog="Y'know, the funny thing is, somehow I find her more appealing" name="GEORGE" /><sd>now... It's like if I knew she was a lesbian when we went out,</sd><char dialog="" name="I" /><sd>never would've broken up with her.</sd><char dialog="Lemme see if I understand this... On second thought..." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Here he is... that's the guy! (rolls up window)" name="JERRY" /><sd>No, thank you, go back... go back... I'll park it!

I'll pay you back." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Yeah, *sure*... I gotta go." name="SUSAN" /><char dialog="Listen. Let me ask you something. If you and Mona were ever" name="GEORGE" /><sd>to... dance, how do you decide who leads? I mean... do you take</sd><sd>turns? Do you discuss it beforehand? How does that work?</sd><char dialog="You're an idiot." name="SUSAN" /><char dialog="Why? That's a *legitimate* sociological question." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I'll see ya. And George, by the way... You stink... Real bad." name="SUSAN" /><char dialog="It's not me! It's the car!" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I didn't think I'd come." name="MONA" /><char dialog="I knew you would." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Oh, Kramer!" name="MONA" /><char dialog="We spray everything with Ozium-D, let it de-ionise, vacuum the" name="CAR WASHER" /><sd>spray out with a de-ionising machine. Hit it with high-pressure</sd><sd>compressed air, and wet-dry vac it to extract the remaining</sd><sd>liquids. We top it off with one of our seven air-fresheners, in</sd><sd>your case, I would recommend the Jasmine, or the Potpourri.</sd><char dialog="Let's do it." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="The first thing we're gonna do is flush the follicles with the" name="HAIRDRESSER" /><sd>five essential oils. Then, we put you under a vapour machine,</sd><sd>and then a heated cap. Then, we shampoo and shampoo and</sd><sd>condition and condition. Then, we saturate the hair in diluted</sd><sd>vinegar-- two parts vinegar, 10 parts water. Now, if that</sd><sd>doesn't work, we have one last resort. Tomato sauce.</sd><char dialog="Tomato Sauce?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Wait a minute! It still smells! It still smells!" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="It still smells." name="CARL" /><char dialog="It still smells!" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="How could it still smell after all that?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I don't know!" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Well, what are you gonna do?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I'll tell you what I'm gonna do, I'm selling that car!" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="You're *selling* the car!?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="You don't understand what I'm up against. This is a force more" name="JERRY" /><sd>powerful than anything you can imagine. Even *Superman* would be</sd><sd>helpless against this kind of stench. And I'll take anything I can</sd><sd>get for it.</sd><char dialog="Maybe I'll buy it." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Are you crazy? Don't you understand what I'm saying to you? This" name="JERRY" /><sd>is not just an odour-- you need a *priest* to get rid of this thing!</sd><char dialog="I still smell!" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="You see! You see what I'm saying to you? It's a presence! It's" name="JERRY" /><sd>the beast!</sd><char dialog="Kramer! Kramer!

And now, he's taken Mona away from me.</sd><char dialog="He stole your girlfriend?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Yes. She's in *love* with him." name="SUSAN" /><char dialog="Amazing. I drive them to lesbianism, he brings 'em back." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="That's the *least* of what you've accomplished..." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Wait a minute, wait a minute.

Instead of putting your laundry in</sd><sd>the hamper, you'd put it in a vase. You'd go down to the drugstore</sd><sd>and pick up some odourant and perspirant. You'd probably have a</sd><sd>dirty sweat sock hanging from the rear-view mirror of your car.</sd><sd>And then on a really special night, maybe a little underwear comin'</sd><sd>out of your breast pocket.
