Susan thought we'd really get along - I guess because we're both wacko! (Jerry laughs) You know what, um.. (Turns around, picking up a large gift from a table) You have to give this to them for me.

Why?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="(Explaining) Because he hasn't called me since we got back..

The clothes in his suitcase are covered in bar-b-que sauce)</set><char dialog="Ohh.. look at this.." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="What?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="I bought a bottle of BBQ sauce in Memphis.

I'm sure that we can still salvage some sauce.." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="I don't care about the sauce.

That's what she had me lug up from Memphis?!" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Pretty chintzy, huh? Considering the money she makes.. She's a big executive for Federal Express." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Federal Express?! Is she out of her mind? Why didn't she just ship it?!" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Look, it's personalized. (Holds it up, reading) &quot;The Costanzas&quot;" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="No, no. Forget it. I don't want it. Let's just get rid of it." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Well, maybe your father would be interested in that." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="I doubt it. You know what he's doing now? He's putting a pool table in my old bedroom." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="(Interested) Oh yeah? Well, maybe I'll go out there and knock a few balls around with him. You know, show him a thing or two.." name="KRAMER" /><set>(George's old bedroom)</set><set>(The room is remodeled into a billiard room. The pool table is obviously way too big for the room.

You want to come see me on the Charles Grodin show?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Who else is on the show?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Uh.. one of the three tenors." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="(Interested) The Three Tenors?

It's not Domingo.." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="(Extremely excited) The other guy?!" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="(Nodding) Yeah, the other guy." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="(Screams out in joy) My God! I can't believe the other guy's going to be on the show!" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Why?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Because I ruined this autographed picture of him that belonged to the Maestro.

You were in bed with your mother last night?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="(Long pause) ..Felt like it. I tell you, this doll is pretty spooky.

And now I got to go back out there and pick up this doormat." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I thought you didn't want the doormat." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I don't. Susan wants to have it out when Sally comes tomorrow." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Sally?

She'll be delighted to talk to you." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="(While opening a cereal box) I will - don't worry. (Plotting revenge) In fact, I'll have her bring up a whole case of the stuff. It'll be really heavy.

A dinosaur!" name="JERRY" /><set>(The Maestro's Office)</set><set>(Kramer and Frank are in a meeting with the Maestro)</set><char dialog="His name was Carlo Costanza. We played together everyday until I was four. If I could just look through your photographs, maybe I could recognize him." name="FRANK" /><char dialog="Unfortunately those photographs are at home." name="MAESTRO" /><char dialog="Well, listen, if you bring 'em by, maybe we could interest you in a game of pool.. Yeah, Frank here - he's got his own billiard room." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="(Trying to concentrate) Yes, It's, uh, it's.. uh, uh.. What do you call it, Kramer?" name="FRANK" /><char dialog="A billiard room." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="No, not billiard.. (Scolding) Not billiards.. it was.. Come on, already. Come on.." name="FRANK" /><char dialog="(Confused) What?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="We call it.. the, uh.." name="FRANK" /><char dialog="(Snaps) The Place To Be!" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="The place to be! Yes! It's the place to be." name="FRANK" /><char dialog="(Agreeing to a game) Ah, then I shall be there. And now, Gentlemen, (Making dramatic actions) if you will excuse me - I must prepare for the symphony." name="MAESTRO" /><char dialog="Oh, yeah?" name="KRAMER" /><set>(The Maestro gets up. Realizing that he isn't wearing pants, Kramer and Frank stare in bewilderment)</set><char dialog="(Noticing the expressions) Ohh, my pants. (Begins putting on a near-by pair of pants) It's an old conductor's trick I learned from Leonard Bernstein." name="MAESTRO" /><char dialog="Really?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="You keep a perfect crease by not sitting in them before the performance." name="MAESTRO" /><set>(Kramer and Frank are obviously impressed)</set><char dialog="That's good thinking." name="KRAMER" /><set>(Jerry's apartment)</set><set>(George, presenting the doll to Jerry, has his arms out in a 'tada' gesture. Jerry has on a disgusted face)</set><char dialog="You see?.. You see?!" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Well, it doesn't look exactly like her." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Jerry, come on. If my mother keeps shrinking, this is exactly what she's gonna look like in ten years!" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Why don't you just get rid of it?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I tried! I almost threw it down the incinerator, but I couldn't do it. The guilt was too overwhelming. (Grabs the doll, opening the door to leave) Susan's so attached to this thing." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Wait, where are you going? Don't take your dolly and go home." name="JERRY" /><set>(George shoots him a look, then leaves. He is audible as he meets up with Elaine in the hallway)</set><char dialog="Hi, Elaine." name="GEORGE" /><set>(Elaine shrieks out in fright, then enters Jerry's doorway - breathless)</set><char dialog="Did you see that?!" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="I'm just glad it's outta here.

(Pointing to a rolled up poster Elaine is carrying)" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Oh, it's a poster of the three tenors." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Oh. (Intercom buzzes, Jerry answers it) Yeah?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="(Through the intercom) It's Sally." name="SALLY" /><char dialog="Oh, did you bring the bar-b-que sauce?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="A whole case." name="SALLY" /><char dialog="(Letting her up) Excellent. (To Elaine) So, did you buy that electric toothbrush I was telling you about?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="(Blunt, to the point) No." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="How come? I told you - It's fantastic." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Eh, I like mine." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="I've had yours, I'm telling you - this one is ten times better. Don't you believe me?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I don't want it." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="(Slightly confused by her behavior) I don't understand this. Why wouldn't you want to get something that's better if I'm telling you it's better? And it's not a little better - it's much better." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="(Not committing to the conversation) It doesn't matter to me." name="ELAINE" /><set>(A knock on the door)</set><char dialog="Come in." name="JERRY" /><set>(Sally enters with a medium-sized box)</set><char dialog="(Peppy) Well, here I am!" name="SALLY" /><char dialog="Oh, hi. Elaine, this is Sally." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Hi." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="How was your flight? (Wishful thinking) Pretty uncomfortable?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="(Setting the box down on his table) Actually, the seat next to me was empty, so, there was no problem at all." name="SALLY" /><char dialog="(Let down) Oh.. (Starts to open the box) Oh, wait.. (Holding up one of the BBQ jars) This isn't the sauce that I asked for!" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="That's right. It's a special gourmet sauce. &quot;The Pride of Memphis!&quot;" name="SALLY" /><char dialog="(Complaining) No, no. I wanted the one in the little bottle with that guy on it that looks like Charles Grodin!" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="This is much better. And frankly, in Memphis, we think that other sauce as (Whispering) kind of a joke." name="SALLY" /><char dialog="I know it's a joke. It's supposed to be a joke! Now I'm going on the Charles Grodin Show with nothing.

You can't even taste it!" name="DOLL" /><char dialog="(Losing it) Don't tell me how to eat!" name="GEORGE" /><set>(People from near-by tables turn and look at him)</set><char dialog="You're wearing that shirt? You've had it for five years already! Why don't you get a new shirt?!" name="DOLL" /><char dialog="(Trying to keep it down) Because I like this one!
