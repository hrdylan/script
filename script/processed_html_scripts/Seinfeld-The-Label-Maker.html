No, my Tim Whatley?</sd><char dialog="The same, he sent it as a thank you for my Super Bowl tickets." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I think this is the same one I gave him. He recycled this gift.

George, this is Scott, my roommate.</sd><sd>Scott walks into the kitchen.</sd><char dialog="Heh heh." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Here, check out this view.

Oh, I'm sure I've mentioned him." name="BONNIE" /><char dialog="No, you didn't mention it." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="He's a great guy, you'll really like him." name="BONNIE" /><char dialog="I'm sure I will." name="GEORGE" /><sd>George and Jerry are at the coffee shop.</sd><char dialog="Male roommate, huh?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yes. A male roommate." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Is this a problem?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="It's a huge problem, Jerry. The hardest part about having sex with a" name="GEORGE" /><sd>woman is getting her to come back to your place! He's already got that.</sd><char dialog="Well, maybe he's --" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No. Believe me, he's not." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="So he's an eligible receiver." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="She's confiding in him about our dates. You always like the person you" name="GEORGE" /><sd>talk to about the date more than the date! It's just a matter of time till they</sd><sd>realize, 'Hey, we could have sex.'</sd><char dialog="What's stopping them?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Exactly! You know how they get animals to reproduce in captivity?" name="GEORGE" /><sd>They just put them in the same cage.</sd><char dialog="What does he look like?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Oh, that's the worst part of it. He looks just like me." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="He looks like you and he's working from the inside?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I look like me and I'm working from the outside. Who do you think is" name="GEORGE" /><sd>in the better position?</sd><char dialog="Not you." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Ho ho. This bizarre ?harrod? experiment must end!" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="We'll take a check please." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I gotta find a way to work this out, I love that apartment. It's so" name="GEORGE" /><sd>cozy, I'm ensconced in velvet. You know, if it were socially acceptable--</sd><char dialog="I know, you would drape yourself in velvet." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I've said that before?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Many times.

I saw Newman talking to the super." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="So what?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="The super has keys to your apartment. Don't you see what's going on?" name="KRAMER" /><sd>Newman is planning a sneak attack.</sd><char dialog="Oh, maybe he's got no hot water." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah, alright, fine. You sit there and you watch while Newman takes" name="KRAMER" /><sd>over the world. But he'd be a horrible leader. And you know who's gonna</sd><sd>suffer? The little people; you and George.</sd><char dialog="Are you through?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Oh. I talked to Arthur Jobanian. Yeah, the Drake's wedding? That's" name="KRAMER" /><sd>off.</sd><char dialog="The wedding is off? What happened?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="The Drake, he found out that the wedding is on the same day as the" name="KRAMER" /><sd>Super Bowl. So he wanted to postpone it, they got in a big argument and *phlf*</sd><sd>it's over.</sd><sd>Jerry and George are entering Jerry's apartment.</sd><char dialog="The wedding is off. Now you can go to the Super Bowl." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I can't call Tim Whatley and ask for the tickets back." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="You just gave them to him two days ago, he's gotta give you a grace" name="GEORGE" /><sd>period.</sd><char dialog="Are you even vaguely familiar with the concept of giving? There's no" name="JERRY" /><sd>grace period.</sd><char dialog="Well, didn't he regift the label maker?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Possibly." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Well, if he can regift, why can't you degift?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="You may have a point." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I have a point, I have a point." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Alright, I'll call him." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah. What's that?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Oh, it's Risk, it's a game of world domination being played by two guys" name="JERRY" /><sd>who can barely run their own lives. (Picks up phone and dials) Hello Tim?</sd><sd>Yeah, hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld, remember those tickets I gave you? Well it turns</sd><sd>out I can use them. Oh, you do? I understand. Okay. Bye. He already made</sd><sd>plans, he can't change them.</sd><char dialog="Well they're his tickets, he can do what he wants" name="GEORGE" /><sd>with them.</sd><char dialog="Thanks." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Alright, I gotta go. I'm heading over to Bonnie's." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="What are you gonna do about the roommate?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I gotta try and find a way to switch places with him. It's like a" name="GEORGE" /><sd>Sigfried and Roy trick.</sd><char dialog="Well, the pickle breath is a good start." name="JERRY" /><sd>George leaves, Newman enters, or would except Jerry tries slamming the door on</sd><sd>him.</sd><char dialog="Hello Jerry, may I come in?" name="NEWMAN" /><char dialog="What do you want?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Nothing, just being neighborly. Do you wanna hang out? Shoot the breeze?" name="NEWMAN" /><char dialog="I'm not letting you cheat, Newman. You're not getting anywhere near" name="JERRY" /><sd>that board.</sd><char dialog="Jerry? I'm a little insulted." name="NEWMAN" /><char dialog="You're not a little anything, Newman. So just pack it up and move it" name="JERRY" /><sd>out of here.</sd><char dialog="Oh, by the way, what are you doing for the Super Bowl?" name="NEWMAN" /><char dialog="I dunno, watch it on TV I guess. Why?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Well if you watch closely enough, you just might see me. I'll be the" name="NEWMAN" /><sd>one waving to the camera from my seat on the forty yard line.</sd><char dialog="You're going to the Super Bowl?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yes I am, a guy on my mail route just got a couple of tickets and he" name="NEWMAN" /><sd>offered one to me.</sd><char dialog="What's his name?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Tim Whatley." name="NEWMAN" /><char dialog="That's my ticket!" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Is it?! Ohhh, well if only you'd known, you could have saved some time" name="NEWMAN" /><sd>and given it directly to me! Ha ha ha.</sd><char dialog="Newman!" name="JERRY" /><sd>George and Bonnie are at Bonnie's</sd><char dialog="What a movie. Good choice." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Thank Scott. He recommended it." name="BONNIE" /><char dialog="Oh, Scott, Scott. He's really great, isn't he?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Yes he is." name="BONNIE" /><char dialog="Yes he is. Let me ask you something. When you come out of the shower" name="GEORGE" /><sd>and you put your robe on, do you cinch it real tight, are you concerned about</sd><sd>that?</sd><char dialog="George?" name="BONNIE" /><char dialog="Do you hold the neck together with one hand, or are you just letting it" name="GEORGE" /><sd>flap in the breeze?</sd><char dialog="George, you're being ridiculous." name="BONNIE" /><char dialog="What's the massage situation?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="What do you mean?" name="BONNIE" /><char dialog="Is there any work being done? Is there any rubbing, touching, finger" name="GEORGE" /><sd>manipulation on the other person, and if so, who's making the request?</sd><char dialog="George, would you just stop?" name="BONNIE" /><char dialog="Say you go to the bathroom at two o'clock in the morning, what's the" name="GEORGE" /><sd>outfit? I mean, you dressing up or is it come as you are?</sd><char dialog="George, what is wrong with you?" name="BONNIE" /><char dialog="I'll tell you what's wrong, a grown woman with a male roommate! It's" name="GEORGE" /><sd>unnatural, it's an abomination!</sd><sd>Scott enters.</sd><char dialog="Hey!" name="SCOTT" /><char dialog="Hey!" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="How ya going?" name="SCOTT" /><char dialog="I'm good." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Are you gonna need the bathroom? 'Cause I'm gonna jump in" name="SCOTT" /><sd>the shower.</sd><char dialog="No, just throw my bras out of the way." name="BONNIE" /><sd>Elaine and Tim Whatley are walking together on the street.</sd><char dialog="Well, this is my building." name="TIM" /><char dialog="Yes it is." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="This was fun, you know?" name="TIM" /><char dialog="Yeah." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="So, I'll call." name="TIM" /><char dialog="Aren't you gonna invite me upstairs?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Upstairs? You wanna go upstairs?" name="TIM" /><char dialog="I would love to go upstairs." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Elaine, you are something else. No one can ever put a label on you, huh?" name="TIM" /><char dialog="We'll see." name="ELAINE" /><sd>Jerry and George are at their booth in the coffee shop.</sd><char dialog="Newman. He's going with Newman." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="How does Tim Whatley even know Newman?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Newman's his mailman." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Who goes to the Super Bowl with their mailman?!" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Who goes *anywhere* with Newman?!" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Well, he's merry." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="He is merry, I'll give him that. (notices a cactus on the table)" name="JERRY" /><sd>What's this plant for?</sd><char dialog="I had a little tiff with Bonnie about the roommate." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Oh, well the cactus will smooth things over." name="JERRY" /><sd>Elaine enters.</sd><char dialog="Hey, guess what? I'm going to the Super Bowl with Tim Whatley." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="What?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="We went out for coffee last night and he offered me a ticket." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="What about the label maker?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Ah, well." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Wait a minute, that's my ticket! You didn't even want to go." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="It was totally out of the blue. We went upstairs to his apartment, you" name="ELAINE" /><sd>know, to look for the label maker.</sd><char dialog="So, how did you get up there? Did you say you had to use the bathroom?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Then how'd you get up there?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I said, &quot;Do you wanna go upstairs?&quot;" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="And there's you ticket." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="What?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="That's why you're going to the Super Bowl." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Why?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="You go out with a guy one time, you ask him to go upstairs like you're" name="JERRY" /><sd>Mae West? Of course he's gonna try and get you alone for the weekend.</sd><char dialog="You mean just because I asked him to go upstairs, he thinks he's going" name="ELAINE" /><sd>downtown?</sd><char dialog="Obviously." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="You're crazy." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Well, what happened when you got upstairs?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="As soon as we walked in, he got a call from one of his patients with an" name="ELAINE" /><sd>impacted molar or something so he had to leave. I didn't even get a chance to</sd><sd>look for the label maker.</sd><char dialog="Yeah, well I don't trust this guy. I think he regifted, he degifted," name="JERRY" /><sd>and now he's using an upstairs invite as a springboard to a Super Bowl sex romp.</sd><sd>Jerry is in the hallway approaching his apartment door. Kramer walks out of his</sd><sd>apartment.</sd><char dialog="Hey." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Hey. What are you doing?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I'm watching your door." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="My door?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah, from my peephole. Fisheye, sees all." name="KRAMER" /><sd>Cut to the interior of Jerry's apartment. Newman sneaks out from the bedroom</sd><sd>towards the table where the Risk board is sitting. He accidentally knocks some</sd><sd>CDs off the shelving unit, making a lot of noise.</sd><char dialog="What was that?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Newman!" name="KRAMER" /><sd>Jerry begins opening the door, Newman does not have enough time to change the</sd><sd>board pieces.</sd><char dialog="Damn!" name="NEWMAN" /><char dialog="The bedroom!" name="JERRY" /><sd>Jerry runs to the bedroom, catching a glimpse of Newman climbing out the open</sd><sd>window and up the fire escape. Jerry and Kramer rush to the window.</sd><char dialog="I see you, Newman! I see you!" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I'm taking the Congo as a penalty!" name="KRAMER" /><sd>Elaine and Tim Whatley are sharing a cab.</sd><char dialog="I've got a confession to make." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Oh? What's that?" name="TIM" /><char dialog="I've got Super Bowl fever." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Oh yeah, me too." name="TIM" /><char dialog="So where are we staying?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Oh, the Ambassador." name="TIM" /><char dialog="Oh. Big room?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="It's a regular room, but it's right downtown." name="TIM" /><char dialog="Downtown?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Right downtown." name="TIM" /><char dialog="What do they have there, a couple of beds?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Why? You bringing someone else?" name="TIM" /><char dialog="No, but don't you think there should be two beds? There's two of us." name="ELAINE" /><sd>Tim's grin disappears.</sd><sd>George enters Bonnie's apartment.</sd><char dialog="Oh, a cactus." name="BONNIE" /><char dialog="They don't need any water, so you don't have to keep taking them to the" name="GEORGE" /><sd>bathroom.</sd><sd>They share a laugh. Scott enters from the back holding a cardboard box. He</sd><sd>places it on a stack of similar boxes.</sd><char dialog="Well, look who's here." name="SCOTT" /><char dialog="I asked Scott to move out." name="BONNIE" /><char dialog="Oh. Oh!" name="GEORGE" /><sd>George and Jerry are at Jerry's apartment. Kramer and Newman are seated at the</sd><sd>Risk board on the living room table.</sd><char dialog="So she kicked him out of the apartment." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="That's right. It's just me and her." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Wow, she rearranged her whole life for you." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I guess she did. He's gone, now I'm the man." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="That's not a good role for you." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No, it's not." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="You unwittingly made a major commitment. That's a lot of pressure." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Oh my god." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="You wanted to be ensconced in velvet, you're buried." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I had the perfect situation here, he was shouldering half the load." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="He was shouldering." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I couldn't leave well enough alone?!" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Where are you going?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I gotta go help her tape up all his boxes and get them ready for" name="GEORGE" /><sd>shipping.</sd><char dialog="Oh, well here. Take Whatley's label maker, I don't want to see it" name="JERRY" /><sd>again.</sd><char dialog="Thanks." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Yeah. I am taking over South America and there" name="KRAMER" /><sd>ain't nothing you can do about it.</sd><char dialog="So, too bad about that Super Bowl ticket, eh Newman?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah. I just hope Tim Whatley's electric bills don't suddenly get lost" name="NEWMAN" /><sd>in the mail, or it could be lights out for him.</sd><char dialog="Thanks for having me over, guys." name="JERRY" /><sd>Jerry and George are out on the street, Tim Whatley comes running up.</sd><char dialog="Alright, I'll see you later." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Hey Jerry?" name="TIM" /><char dialog="Ah, Tim Whatley. Out scalping?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Ah, see, now I've been thinking a lot about what happened and I feel" name="TIM" /><sd>horrible. Listen, I want to give you a ticket back.</sd><char dialog="Are you serious, what about Elaine?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Oh, Elaine. Yeah, well, things just didn't work out like I thought they" name="TIM" /><sd>would.</sd><char dialog="Oh. (notices a car being jacked up by a tow truck) Hey, isn't this" name="JERRY" /><sd>Kramer's car? (yelling up) Hey, Cosmo!! They're towing your car!!</sd><char dialog="What?! Not my car!! Hey!! They're towing my" name="KRAMER" /><sd>car!!</sd><sd>Kramer runs out the door, leaving Newman alone with the Risk board, but only for</sd><sd>a moment. He runs back in and grabs the board.</sd><char dialog="What are you doing?" name="NEWMAN" /><char dialog="I'm taking the board with me." name="KRAMER" /><sd>Kramer runs out carrying the board, Newman follows a moment later.</sd><sd>Back on the street, Kramer's car is jacked up and the driver is just taking off.</sd><sd>Kramer comes running after it, yelling at the driver and balancing the game</sd><sd>board with Newman at his heels.</sd><char dialog="So, I guess I'll see you at the game." name="TIM" /><char dialog="Yeah, see you there." name="JERRY" /><sd>George walks into Bonnie's apartment, *everything* is boxed up and Bonnie is</sd><sd>taping up the last of the boxes. He knocks to get her attention.</sd><char dialog="Hi, George." name="BONNIE" /><char dialog="What, what happened? Where's, where's all the stuff?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="It's gone. It was all his. Is this a label maker?" name="BONNIE" /><char dialog="The table, the stereo, the VCR, the velvet couch, where's the velvet?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="They were his. Besides, we don't need any of those things.

Come on." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="I can't think, there's all this noise." name="NEWMAN" /><char dialog="Or is it because I've built a stronghold around Greenland? I've driven" name="KRAMER" /><sd>you out of Western Europe and I've left you teetering on the brink of complete</sd><sd>annihilation.</sd><char dialog="I'm not beaten yet. I still have armies in the Ukraine." name="NEWMAN" /><sd>This comment perks up the ears of what appears to be a Russian immigrant.</sd><char dialog="Ha ha, the Ukraine. Do you know what the Ukraine is? It's a sitting" name="KRAMER" /><sd>duck. A road apple, Newman. The Ukraine is weak. It's feeble. I think it's</sd><sd>time to put the hurt on the Ukraine.</sd><char dialog="I come from Ukraine.
