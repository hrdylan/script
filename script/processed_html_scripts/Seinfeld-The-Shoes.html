We know when something's funny!" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="It cannot not be funny! Now come on, let's stay with it, we gotta finish this today." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Okay. Hey, you know what, maybe I should give it to my therapist to read. She's smart, I trust her." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Yeah, maybe I'll give it to Elaine." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Hey, you know, we haven't brought the Elaine character into the show yet. We should try and get her into this scene." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Right, right. Okay. (Writing) Elaine enters.

That's why I'm in therapy." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="You know, if we bring Elaine in, it's going to be so many people to keep track of.

Gail Cunningham." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Did you talk to her?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Well, I was on my way to the Y, and I saw her coming towards me? I didn't know what to do! Because I remembered you had three dates with her and she wouldn't kiss you goodnight. So now I'm thinking, what is my duty to my friend? Do I acknowledge her? Do I ignore her? I mean, what is my responsibility here?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="So what happened?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah, yeah, so she sees me and she goes, (imitates Gail) &quot;Oh, hi! Kramer!&quot; You know? Like nothing happened! Like she never went three dates with you and refused to kiss you goodnight." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Yeah, I know about the three dates." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="You know what I did? I snubbed her." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="What do you mean, you snubbed her?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I walked right by her - bffffft - never said a word." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Right by her?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Right by her!" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="What you do say about a guy like this, huh! (George applauds.) You are some great friend, I tell ya, snubbed her! (seriously) Not that I condone it. I've never condoned snubbing in my administration. Your loyalty is beyond question." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah. Well, you know, she was lucky I was in a good mood - coulda been a lot worse." name="KRAMER" /><sd>New scene - Jerry and Elaine at the coffee shop. Jerry is showing her the script.</sd><char dialog="I'm not even in here!" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Yeah, I know." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I thought there was going to be a character named Elaine Benes." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Well, there were too many people in the room, we couldn't keep track of everybody. George, and the butler, and..." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="You couldn't &quot;keep track&quot; of everybody?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Well, we tried. We couldn't. We didn't know how to, uh...(confessing) ...we couldn't write for a woman. We didn't know what you would say. Even right now, I'm sitting here, I know you're going to say something, I have no idea what it is." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="You have no idea?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Something derogatory? (Gail enters the coffee shop and walks over to the booth.)" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I thought I'd find you here." name="GAIL" /><char dialog="Well, Gail Cunningham." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Hi, Gail." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Hi, Elaine. (To Jerry) Hey, what is with your friend Kramer?" name="GAIL" /><char dialog="Why?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="He snubbed me." name="GAIL" /><char dialog="Are you sure?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah, I'm sure. What did you tell him?" name="GAIL" /><char dialog="Nothing. (Elaine grabs Jerry's sandwich and is about to take a bite.) Hey, where you goin' with that? Gimme that. (Takes back the sandwich.)" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I thought you were finished." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="I took two bites, how am I finished? (Elaine coughs.) Plus you're coming down with something? You want me to get sick? (Offers Gail the sandwich) Bite?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="So, how come? Why did Kramer do that?" name="GAIL" /><char dialog="I don't know. Once he leaves the building, he's out of my jurisdiction." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Well, tell him that I am mad at him." name="GAIL" /><char dialog="Alright. So, where ya cookin' now?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Pfeiffer's." name="GAIL" /><char dialog="Ah, the power lunch crowd." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Nice shoes!" name="GAIL" /><char dialog="Oh. Thank you." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Where'd you get 'em?" name="GAIL" /><char dialog="They're um, Botticelli's." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Ooh, Botticelli's! Look at you! I'm afraid to go in there." name="GAIL" /><char dialog="Really." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Would you care to join us?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No, no, I gotta get to the restaurant.

(Exits.)" name="GAIL" /><char dialog="See ya." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="&quot;Oh, look at you, the Botticelli's.&quot;" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="That bothered you?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yes, it bothered me. So I bought a pair of shoes at Botticelli's, I'm not allowed to shop there? That really embarrassed me." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="It did?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yes! Couldn't you see that?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="No. This is why you're not in the pilot." name="JERRY" /><sd>New scene - George in a session with Dana, his therapist.</sd><char dialog="Well, George, I think you're beginning to get some perspective on things. I think we're making progress." name="DANA" /><char dialog="Yeah, I feel like I've grown." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Good. So, let's pick up on this next week." name="DANA" /><char dialog="Great. (They both stand.) Oh, by the way, did you get a chance to read the script?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Yes, yes I did." name="DANA" /><char dialog="Well, what'd you think?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Uh...it was...good." name="DANA" /><char dialog="You didn't like it?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Well, no, I -" name="DANA" /><char dialog="I can't believe this! What was wrong with it? What didn't you like about it?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="It wasn't funny." name="DANA" /><char dialog="It wasn't funny? What, are you kidding?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="No, I didn't find it funny." name="DANA" /><char dialog="You didn't find it funny?! This is what I'm paying for?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Well, that whole storyline about a guy who gets into a car accident, doesn't have any insurance, so the judge sentences him to be a butler? I didn't really buy that." name="DANA" /><char dialog="Let me tell you who did, uh, buy it...we pitched this story to Russell Dalrymple, the president of NBC, and he ate it up with a spoon." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="George, if you're going to be in a creative field, you're going to have to learn how to deal with criticism." name="DANA" /><char dialog="How's this for criticism? Um...you stink. How do like that criticism? You know what's funny to me? That diploma up on the wall. That is my idea of &quot;com-med-dee&quot;! You sitting here, telling people what to do." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I think you'd better go." name="DANA" /><char dialog="Oh, I'm goin' baby. I'm goin.' (Heads for the door, then stops.) It's Jerry's fault. He took out all my good lines. He's such a control freak!" name="GEORGE" /><sd>New scene - Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment. They're both standing by the door. Elaine enters.</sd><char dialog="So, you send me to this therapist to help me with my emotional disorders, and she criticizes our script. (Tosses the script to Jerry.) What kind of a therapist is that?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I guess she didn't think it was funny." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Oh, she didn't think it was funny. What is she, Rowan &amp; Martin? We're supposed to meet with NBC tomorrow! She completely shattered my confidence. And I'm paying for this, she's my employee!" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I thought your mother's paying for it." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="And she slaves to earn every penny. So that someday, I might be able to walk up to a woman and say, &quot;Yes, I'm bald, but I'm still a good person.&quot;" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="You know, he's right. It's not her place to criticize the script, which reminds me - what did you think of it? You never told me." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="What did I think of it? (Manufactures a cough instead of answering. Kramer enters.)" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Hey, buddy, I got something to tell ya. (Elaine runs towards to the bathroom in lieu of answering Jerry's question.)" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Hey, one second, you don't get off that easy. C'mon, tell me what you thought." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Well, you know, I..." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="I just kissed Gail Cunningham. (Jerry turns and looks at Kramer, shocked. Elaine grins and heads to the bathroom.)" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="You what?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah, I kissed her." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="You kissed her?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Right on the mouth." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="What kinda great friend are you? How do you go from snubbing to kissing?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Well, I saw her outside the Y, you know, she came up to me, she started yelling because I snubbed her, and then we started talking a little bit, and I walked her to her building. And just before I left, I put my arm around her waist, I pulled her to me, and I - mmm - I planted one! (Laughs.)" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="And what did she do?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="She kissed me back." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="I don't get this. I go out with this girl three times, she doesn't want to shake my hand - why's she kissing you?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Because I snubbed her. You see? Women, they like that! Yes! I understand women. The snub is good, they love the snub!" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="No they don't. I tried that once. I snubbed for a year. Nothing. Every woman I saw, I snubbed. You never saw people so pleased. (Elaine returns from the bathroom.)" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Ooh, so...I understand you're buying new shoes now at Botticelli's." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="What? Who told you that?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Gail Cunningham." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="I don't understand, why is this woman talking about my shoes? Why are my shoes a topic of conversation?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Well, you know, we were just talking, and she mentioned how you're buying your shoes now at Botticelli's." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="&quot;How I'm buying my shoes now at Botticelli's!&quot; Did you hear this? (Shoves Jerry and Kramer.)" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="So what?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="So what?! She is talking about my shoes! She is discussing my shoes! It is nobody's business where I buy my shoes! (Storms over to the couch and angrily sits down. Jerry, Kramer and George look at Elaine from the kitchen, comically puzzled by her outburst...)" name="ELAINE" /><sd>New scene - Gail cooking in the kitchen at Pfeiffer's Restaurant. Elaine marches in.</sd><char dialog="Hey! Gail!" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Elaine...!" name="GAIL" /><char dialog="Why are you talking about my shoes?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="What?" name="GAIL" /><char dialog="My Botticelli shoes. You've been talking about my Botticelli shoes." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="What are you talking about?" name="GAIL" /><char dialog="Did you or did you not tell Kramer that I got my shoes at Botticelli's? (A waiter comes over and puts a plate of food on Gail's cutting board.)" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Too spicy. He wants another one. You got that pasta primavera?" name="WAITER" /><char dialog="Look Elaine, I am very busy here." name="GAIL" /><char dialog="Who else have you mentioned my shoes to, huh? I wanna know why my footwear is your conversation!" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="I am not discussing this. This is insane." name="GAIL" /><char dialog="You got that pasta primavera? Let's go! (Gail passes the plate to the waiter in front of Elaine. Elaine sneezes on it. The waiter brings the pasta to the dining room and serves it to Russell Dalrymple, the president of NBC.) Here you are, Mr. Dalrymple." name="WAITER" /><char dialog="Thank you." name="RUSSELL" /><char dialog="Sorry for the delay. Enjoy your lunch." name="WAITER" /><sd>New scene - Jerry and George arrive at Dalrymple's apartment to discuss the script.</sd><char dialog="Well, come in. (They shake hands.) Awfully sorry to make you come up here, but I really wasn't feeling well enough to go back to the office, and well, it's the only chance I have to meet with you this week." name="RUSSELL" /><char dialog="Are you alright?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Well, it's my stomach. I think there must have been something in the pasta primavera I had for lunch." name="RUSSELL" /><char dialog="Where did you eat?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Pfeiffer's." name="RUSSELL" /><char dialog="Ah. I know the chef there." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah. The food's usually terrific." name="RUSSELL" /><char dialog="My cousin worked for Bouchard's. They used to use the bouilla-base for a toilet. (Jerry and Russell are shocked.)" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="What are you saying?" name="RUSSELL" /><char dialog="Well, you didn't hear it from me, but needless to say, if you go in there - stick with the consumee." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Well, we'd better get started, my daughter's going to be here soon." name="RUSSELL" /><char dialog="Oh, you have a daughter?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah, she just turned fifteen last week." name="RUSSELL" /><char dialog="Aw, that's a fun age. (Jerry looks at George distastefully.)" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Alright. The script. Now, I've read this thing three times...and everytime I read it...(looks nauseous, struggles not to vomit.)" name="RUSSELL" /><char dialog="What?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Excuse me for a second. (Gets up and runs to the bathroom.)" name="RUSSELL" /><char dialog="Would you like a Pepto-Bismol? I keep them in my wallet...! (Russell goes into the bathroom and shuts the door.) (To Jerry) Do you think he liked it? (From the bathroom, we hear Russell violently heaving his guts.)" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I'm not sure. (The sounds of Russell vomiting emanate from the bathroom. Jerry and George sit there uncomfortably.) What was that dish he said he had...?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Pasta primavera." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Ah. You know, 'primavera' is Italian for 'spring.'" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No!" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Yeah." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Really, I'm terribly sorry, it just, uh...all of a sudden it just hit me." name="RUSSELL" /><char dialog="So, you were saying how, um...about the script..." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Right. The script. Your script needs some...it needs, um...(looks nauseous again. Gets up and runs to the bathroom a second time.)" name="RUSSELL" /><char dialog="More jokes?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Another ending?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="A different name for the butler? (Russell throws up again.)" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Maybe we should go." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="We haven't heard his notes yet, we don't know how he feels about our work. (Russell throws up yet again.)" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Oh God. Oh my god." name="RUSSELL" /><char dialog="I can't listen to anymore of this, the guy's losing a lung in there.

(Russell vomits again. Jerry and George look ashamed.)" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Daddy? Are you okay?" name="MOLLY" /><char dialog="Yeah, sweetie. I'm fine. (Molly sits on the back of the chair.)" name="RUSSELL" /><char dialog="So, you live with your mother, huh?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Uh, yeah." name="MOLLY" /><char dialog="Divorce is very difficult. Especially on a kid. Of course, I'm the result of my parents having stayed together, so you never know. (Russell comes out of the bathroom.)" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Daddy, are you alright? What's the matter?" name="MOLLY" /><char dialog="It's just a stomach thing." name="RUSSELL" /><char dialog="Yuck." name="MOLLY" /><char dialog="We're going to have to do this some other time, so if you'll give me your number, I'll call you later. (Jerry and George nod. Molly takes her jacket off.)" name="RUSSELL" /><char dialog="You know, suddenly I'm in the mood for pasta primavera myself. (Jerry nudges George to sneak a peek at Molly's cleavage as she bends over and looks in her backpack. Jerry has a quick look, but George stares, hypnotized. Russell comes up behind George.)" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Get a good look, Costanza?" name="RUSSELL" /><sd>New scene - Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment.</sd><char dialog="What were you doing?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Well, it's not my fault. You poked me!" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="You're supposed to just take a peek after a poke. You were like you just put a quarter into one of those big metal things on top of the Empire State Building." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="It's cleavage. I couldn't look away. What am I, waiting to win an Oscar here? This is all I have in my life." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Looking at cleavage is like looking at the sun, you don't stare at it. It's too risky. You get a sense of it and then you look away." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="All right. So, he caught me in a cleavage peek, so big deal. Who wouldn't look at his daughter's cleavage? She's got nice cleavage." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="That's why I poked." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="That's why I peeked. (Jerry opens the door to take some trash out, and meets Kramer and Gail in the hallway.)" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Hey! What is with your friend Elaine?" name="GAIL" /><char dialog="What?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="She comes to my restaurant, comes right in my kitchen, and starts complaining that I'm talking about her shoes." name="GAIL" /><char dialog="Right in the kitchen. Disgraceful." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="I don't want people coming into my kitchen. I think she might have sneezed all over someone's pasta primavera. Someone might have gotten sick because of her. (Kramer and Gail exit.)" name="GAIL" /><char dialog="Pasta primavera?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Is that what she said? (Kramer pokes his head back in the door.)" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="She's somethin', huh? She's a wild one. She's wearin' me out." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="She is?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="She's sensual. You know, with the...cooking and all. (Kramer grins happily at Jerry and leaves. The phone rings. Jerry tosses the trashbag to George.)" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Hello? Oh, hi Stu." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="From NBC?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Yeah. What's goin' on? What? Really? Oh my god....did he give you a reason?...Oh boy. Okay. Alright. Thanks. (hangs up.) Dalrymple just cancelled the pilot.

My shoes are my business. The two of you shouldn't have been looking at some fifteen year-old's cleavage anyway!" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="He poked me!" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="There was cleavage in the area. That's a reflex - (mimics nudging someone with an elbow) - cleavage-poke, cleavage-poke..." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="But she was fifteen." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="You don't consider age in the face of cleavage. This occurs on a molecular level, you can't control it! We're like some kind of weird fish where the eyes operate independently of the head." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Alright, what's the difference. What are we gonna do now? He won't take our calls, we can't get into his office..." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="You know what we could do? He eats at that restaurant, Pfeiffer's? We could have Gail call us, tell us the next time he's there, go there and talk to him." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Hey, now you're onto something." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="The whole thing is so stupid. Like he wouldn't do the same thing if Elaine walked by in a low-cut dress." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah. Well, maybe not Elaine, but...somebody like Gail, though." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="What? What do you mean, Gail? (Kramer enters.)" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Yah-hey." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Kramer, listen, I want you to ask Gail to do me a favor. The next time Russell Dalrymple comes in the restaurant, ask her if she would call me." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Alright, I'll call her right now. (Kramer goes back to his apartment.)" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="What do you mean, Gail? You don't think I can attract attention? You don't think I can put asses in the seats?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Look, sweetheart, you know you've got it all. But let's face it... (Kramer comes back.)" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="She said she'll do it." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Beautiful." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="But she wants the shoes." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="What?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="She says she wants those shoes." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="She wants my shoes? What kind of person is this? Alright! She is not getting 'em!" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="No, come on! I'll buy you another pair!" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No, these were the last pair of these that they had!" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="I'll get you another one just like it!" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No, but these were the only really cool ones like this! Don't you see how everybody likes 'em and how everybody talks about 'em? (Jerry, realizing Elaine's motivation, sits at the counter unbelievingly.)" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Elaine, this pilot...it doesn't matter to me, it's not me I'm concerned about...it's my mother. I've been over to the hospital to see her..." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Oh yeah, because she caught you jer" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="" name="-" /><char dialog="Never mind!" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Oh, come on, wait a second, this whole thing is ridiculous. How do I even know she wears the same size?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Alright, what size are you?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Seven-and-a-half." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Eh! Bingo." name="KRAMER" /><sd>New scene - Gail in the kitchen at Pfeiffer's. She notices Dalrymple being shown to his table.</sd><char dialog="Sauce this. (Goes to the telephone and dials.) Yeah, he's here. Oh, and one more thing...bring the shoes. (Hangs up.)" name="GAIL" /><sd>Continuation of last scene - Russell eating at the restaurant. Jerry and George arrive.

Whattaya know!" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Look who's here!" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Fancy meeting you here!" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Oh. Hello." name="RUSSELL" /><char dialog="Pasta primavera! Back on the horse." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="You know, it's a funny thing, because after the pilot got cancelled, we hadn't heard from you." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Didn't hear anything..." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Didn't know...we were wondering...what happened." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="It just didn't seem to be the right project for us right now. (Elaine walks by in a low-cut dress. Jerry and George look at her as she moves to the table opposite Russell.) So, what were you saying?" name="RUSSELL" /><char dialog="Oh...uh, because if it had anything at all to do with what you perceived as me leering at your daughter, I really have to take issue with that. I did not leer. (To Jerry) Did I leer?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="No leer. (Elaine comes over to Russell's table.)" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Excuse me, are you using that ketchup?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Uh, no. (Elaine takes the ketchup and goes back to her table.)" name="RUSSELL" /><char dialog="Because, if I'm looking straight ahead, and something enters my field of vision, that's merely a happenstance. (Elaine loudly snaps and unfolds her napkin at the next table to get Russell's attention.)" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Under the circumstances, I don't really feel that we should be in business together. (Elaine comes back over.)" name="RUSSELL" /><char dialog="Here's your ketchup back. You know, I had the hardest time trying to get some out. I mean, I just kept pounding and pounding on the bottom of it. Do you have any trouble?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="No." name="RUSSELL" /><char dialog="Do you have a...ketchup secret?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="No, I... (finally notices Elaine)...don't have a ketchup secret. (Smiles.)" name="RUSSELL" /><char dialog="Because if you do have a ketchup secret, I would really, really like to know what it is. (Russell is pleased, and smiles at Elaine. Elaine goes back to her table, sits down, and waves at Russell.)" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Field of vision, huh?" name="RUSSELL" /><sd>Commercial break.</sd><sd>New scene - Jerry, George and Elaine having dinner at Pfeiffer's.

In fact, Elaine's going out with him tomorrow night. (Gail nods and walks away.)
