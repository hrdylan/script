I wouldn't see it again." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="You know, a friend of mine thought she got Legonare's disease in the hot tub." name="MARCY" /><char dialog="Really? What happened?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Oh, yada yada yada, just some bad egg salad. I'll be right back. (She gets up)" name="MARCY" /><char dialog="I noticed she's big on the phrase &quot;yada yada.&quot;" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Is &quot;yada yada&quot; bad?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="No, &quot;yada yada&quot; is good. She's very succinct." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="She is succinct." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Yeah, it's like you're dating USA Today.

I'm a Jew." name="TIM" /><char dialog="Excuse me?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I'm a Jew. I finished converting two days ago." name="TIM" /><char dialog="Well... (Thinking of something to say) Welcome aboard." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Thanks." name="TIM" /><char dialog="Hey, where you just at the health club?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Oh, well, I didn't do much. I just sat in the sauna. You know, it was more like a Jewish workout. I'll see ya. (Jerry and George give confused looks)" name="TIM" /><char dialog="Elaine, the guy's Jewish two days, he's already making Jewish jokes." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="So what? When someone turns twenty-one, they usually get drunk the first night." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Booze is not a religion." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Tell that to my father. Anyway, guess what? Beth Lookner called me." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Ooh. Beth Lookner, still waitin' out hat marriage." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="What are you talking about? That marriage ended six months ago. She's already remarried." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="I gotta get on that internet. I'm late on everything." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Anyway, Beth and her new husband Arnie have listed me a reference for an adoption agency. They're trying to get a baby. (Kramer and Mickey enter wearing the same shirt)" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Elaine, all right, who looks better in this shirt? Me or Mickey?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="We're double dating tonight, and if we wear the same shirt we'll look like idiots." name="MICKEY" /><char dialog="Hmm, turn around. (They turn around) Both so striking." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Tell me about it. We just picked up two women at the Gap." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="How did you decide which one of you would date which girl? (They pause then look at each other)" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="So I'm on 3rd Avenue, mindin' my own business, and, yada yada yada, I get a free massage and a facial." name="MARCY" /><char dialog="What a succinct story." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I'm surprised you drive a Cadillac." name="MARCY" /><char dialog="Oh, it's not mine. It's my mother's." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Are you close with your parents?" name="MARCY" /><char dialog="Well, they gave birth to me, and, yada yada..." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Yada what?" name="MARCY" /><char dialog="Yada yada yada..." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="(To Mickey, wearing the shirt Elaine looked at for them) I like your shirt." name="KAREN" /><char dialog="Well, you too seem to have the same taste." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Well I like it, too." name="JULIE" /><char dialog="Well I have the same shirt." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Yeah, well I'm wearin' it." name="MICKEY" /><char dialog="I like your shirt too." name="JULIE" /><char dialog="Oh, so do I." name="KAREN" /><char dialog="Oh. (Waiter approaches table)" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Anything to drink? Some wine, perhaps." name="WAITER" /><char dialog="I like Merlot." name="MICKEY" /><char dialog="I love Merlot." name="KAREN" /><char dialog="I'm crazy about Merlot." name="JULIE" /><char dialog="I live for Merlot." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="We're out of Merlot." name="WAITER" /><char dialog="So you, uh, know Betha and Arnie pretty well?" name="AGENT" /><char dialog="Oh, yeah, yeah." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Do you socialize with them often?" name="AGENT" /><char dialog="Yeah, we got out to dinner a lot. Usually Chinese, well sometimes Thai. And we go to the movies, Arnie's a real film buff." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Oh." name="AGENT" /><char dialog="Actually, I remember this one time, um, this is funny. Um, we went to see the movie Striptease. I don't know if you've seen... doesn't matter. Anyway, I was whispering something to Beth, and Arnie leens over to me, and he goes, &quot;Would you SHUT UP?!&quot; I mean, he barely even knew me. Where did he get ah-- But they're nice people. (Elaine tries to smile realizing her mistake)" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Oh, you're in here." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="What're you doing here?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I knew you had an appointment." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Well this is very awkward." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I'll leave when the guy comes in. I gotta tell you, I am loving this yada yada thing. You know, I can cross over my whole life story. (Picks up dental tool)" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Hey, you don't play with that. That's going in my mouth." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Hey, what this thing? Whew!" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="All right, that's enough. Now get going. Get outta here. (Tim and his staff enter)" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Hey, Tim. Quick question. Is it normal for your teeth to make noises, like a hissing or a chirping?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="George..." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Um..." name="TIM" /><char dialog="Fine, I'll make an appointment. (He leaves)" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="All right, it is cavity time. Ah, here we go. Which reminds me, did you here the one about the rabbi and the farmer's daughter? Huh?" name="TIM" /><char dialog="Hey." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Those aren't mahtzah balls." name="TIM" /><char dialog="Tim, do you think you should be making jokes like that?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Why not? I'm Jewish, remember?" name="TIM" /><char dialog="I know, but..." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Jerry, it's our sense of humor that sustained us as a people for 3000 years." name="TIM" /><char dialog="" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="" name="5000." /><char dialog="5000, even better. Okay, Chrissie. Give me a schtickle of flouride." name="TIM" /><char dialog="And then he asked the assistant for a schtickle of flouride." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Why are you so concerned about this?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="I'll tell you why. Because I believe Whatley converted to Judaism just for the jokes. (Phone rings)" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Would you be interested in a subscription to the New York Times?" name="PHONE" /><char dialog="Yes. (Slams down phone. Kramer and Mickey enter)" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I don't believe that." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="If you had gotten into the backseat of the car we could've figured this whole thing out." name="MICKEY" /><char dialog="Why were you holding the door open for?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Not for you! Who holds a door open for a man?" name="MICKEY" /><char dialog="Well, I thought it was a nice gesture. But I guess I was wrong!" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Let's just put they're names in a hat." name="MICKEY" /><char dialog="I don't even know their names! Look, why don't you just take the one that was on the left?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="I'm not sure she was my type." name="MICKEY" /><char dialog="Oh, everybody's your type." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="What the hell does that mean?" name="MICKEY" /><char dialog="You've been married three times." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="That's it, it's go time! (Charges toward Kramer, only to be held back by Jerry and Elaine)" name="MICKEY" /><char dialog="All right, take it easy." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Hey, hey, hey!" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Come on, let him go. You want throw? Let's throw!" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Hey! Hold on a second. All right, look, I got an idea. Why don't you just show up early for your next date, sit across from each other, and see who the girls sit next to." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="That's not bad." name="MICKEY" /><char dialog="All right, so we let the girls decide." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Yeah, why should we knock ourselves out?" name="MICKEY" /><char dialog="Yeah, I wanna wear that shirt next time." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="No, no one wears the shirt next time." name="MICKEY" /><char dialog="That's right, 'cause they already saw it." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="We'll look like idiots. (They exit)" name="MICKEY" /><char dialog="Well, we were engaged to be married, uh, we bought the wedding invitations, and, uh, yada yada yada, I'm still single." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="So what's she doing now?" name="MARCY" /><char dialog="Yada." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Speaking of ex's, my old boyfriend came over late last night, and, yada yada yada, anyway. I'm really tired today." name="MARCY" /><char dialog="Beth, Arnie, hi. What's up?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Well our adoption application was denied." name="ARNIE" /><char dialog="Really." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="The adoption agent seems to feel that Arnie has a violent temper." name="BETH" /><char dialog="Oh." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="So we're just asking our friends what they may have said to the adoption agent." name="BETH" /><char dialog="Uh, you know, I just told them what kind people you are and, uh, yada yada yada, that is it." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="How you doing?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I have a discomfort in my molar. (Enter Tim)" name="FATHER" /><char dialog="Well, the Curtis, why don't you come in? (To Jerry) Father Curtis, good guy. Oh, which reminds me, did you hear the one about the Pope and Raquel Welch on the lifeboat, huh? I'll tell you later. (Exits)" name="TIM" /><char dialog="Whatley. (Like &quot;Newman&quot;)" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="What are they doing here?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="I told you we should've gotten here a half hour early." name="MICKEY" /><char dialog="All right, all right. Now what're we gonna do?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="All right, don't panic. Let's just decide now. Which one do you want?" name="MICKEY" /><char dialog="All right, I'll take Julie." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="I knew you wanted her. That's who I wanted." name="MICKEY" /><char dialog="All right, I'll take Karen." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="No, no, you think I'm fallin' for that? I'll take Karen." name="MICKEY" /><char dialog="All right, which one is Julie? (They walk over to the table and fight over who sits where) Hey, you ladies look lovely tonight. (Continue to struggle)" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="So Whatley sayd to me, &quot;Hey, I can make Catholic jokes, I used to be Catholic.&quot;" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="You see, I don't think it is a Catholic joke. I think it's more of a Raquel Welch joke. What was it? No, I said hand me the buoys. (Laughing) Bouys!" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Don't you see what Whatley is after? Total joke telling immunity. He's already got the two big religions covered, if he ever gets Polish citizenship there'll be no stopping him." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="So what're you gonna do?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="I think this Father Curtis might be very interested to hear what Whatley has the Pope doing with Raquel Welch." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="(Calling on phone) Hey, Beth, Arnie, it's Elaine. Um, thought you guys might wanna have lunch. Gimme a call. Bye." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="They're not getting a baby so you're taking them out to lunch?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Thought it would be nice." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Poor Beth." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Hey, Arnie's just as upset." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Oh screw him! (George enters)" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Listen to this. Marcy comes up and she tells me her ex-boyfriend was over late last night, and &quot;yada yada yada, I'm really tired today.&quot; You don't think she yada yada'd sex." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="(Raising hand) I've yada yada'd sex." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Really?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Yeah. I met this lawyer, we went out to dinner, I had the lobster bisk, we went back to my place, yada yada yada, I never heard from him again." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="But you yada yada'd over the best part." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No, I mentioned the bisk." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Well, I gotta do somethin'. (Walks over to bathroom. Kramer enters)" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Well, I gotta do somethin'." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="George is already in there." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="(Confused) No, Mickey and I, we can't work it out. You know, I'm thinking of asking that Karen out by myself." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="I thought you were leaning towards Julie." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I was, but the one I thought was Julie turned out to be Karen." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Well it was a helluva yada yada." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="He's moving to Seattle. We wanted to say goodbye, I was just getting out of the shower, and yada yada yada--" name="MARCY" /><char dialog="All right, enough! Enough! From now on, no more yada yada's. Just give me the full story." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Okay." name="MARCY" /><char dialog="Tell me about the free facial." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Okay, well, like I said I was on 3rd Avenue, and I stopped by a large department store." name="MARCY" /><char dialog="Which one?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Bloomingdale's." name="MARCY" /><char dialog="Very good. Go on." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Oh, and I stole a Piaget watch." name="MARCY" /><char dialog="What's that?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="And then, I was on such a... high, that I went upstairs to the salon on the fifth floor, and got a massage and facial, and skipped out on the bill." name="MARCY" /><char dialog="Shoplifting." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Well, what about you? You told me that you were engaged. What was the rest of that? (Pause)" name="MARCY" /><char dialog="Excuse me, Mother?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Sister." name="NUN" /><char dialog="Sister, right. Do you know when Father Curtis has office hours?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Well not until tomorrow." name="NUN" /><char dialog="Hmm, I really need to speak with him." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="That's a kneeler." name="FATHER" /><char dialog="Oh. (Adjusts accordingly)" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Tell me your sins, my son." name="FATHER" /><char dialog="Well I should tell you that I'm Jewish." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="That's no sin." name="FATHER" /><char dialog="Oh good. Anyway, I wanted to talk to you about Dr. Whatley. I have a suspicion that he's converted to Judaism just for the jokes." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="And this offends you as a Jewish person." name="FATHER" /><char dialog="No, it offends me as a comedian. And it'll interest you that he's also telling Catholic jokes." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Well." name="FATHER" /><char dialog="And they're old jokes. I mean, the Pope and Raquel Welch in a lifeboat." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I haven't heard that one." name="FATHER" /><char dialog="Oh, I'm sure you have. They're out on the ocean and, yada yada yada, and she says, &quot;Those aren't buoys.&quot; (Father starts laughing) Father..." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="One second... Well, if it would make you feel better I could speak to Dr. Whatley. I have to go back and have a wisdom teeth removed." name="FATHER" /><char dialog="You know the difference between a dentist and a sadist don't you?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Um..." name="FATHER" /><char dialog="Newer magazines." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Now if you'll excuse me. (Closes door. George enters confessional.)" name="FATHER" /><char dialog="Jerry, I gotta talk to you." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Hi." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Hi, Kramer." name="KAREN" /><char dialog="Got a minute?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Uh, actually my parents are over, but, would you like to meet them?" name="KAREN" /><char dialog="Sure." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="(Parents enter and are little people like Mickey) Mom, Dad." name="KAREN" /><char dialog="Hi." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Elaine, I have to ask you something. What exactly happened down there?" name="ARNIE" /><char dialog="Well, I don't know. I mean, I talked to him and, blah blah blah, he asked about you guys and, da da da da da, more questions, bleh bleh bleh...." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="All right, shut up!" name="ARNIE" /><char dialog="Again you are telling me to shut up?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="What?" name="ARNIE" /><char dialog="You yelled that time at the movies. That's why you're not getting the baby." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Oh my God. How am I gonna tell Beth?" name="ARNIE" /><char dialog="Look, I'll go down and talk to this adoption guy and I'll make sure that it all gets worked out." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="All right, just don't screw it up this time! (He exits)" name="ARNIE" /><char dialog="See, again with the yelling. Not a fan of the yelling." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="(In pain) Oh, are you about done?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I'm just getting warmed up. Because I'm just a sadist with newer magazines." name="TIM" /><char dialog="Huh?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Father Curtis told me about your little joke." name="TIM" /><char dialog="What about all your Jewish jokes?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I'm Jewish, you're not a dentist. You have no idea what my people have been through." name="TIM" /><char dialog="The Jews?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No, the dentists. You know, we have the highest suicide rate of any profession?" name="TIM" /><char dialog="Is that why it's so hard to get an appointment?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="So, I'll uh... all right. (Hangs up)" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Date with Karen?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No, Julie. She's the one." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="What happened to Karen?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Well, Mickey and her have a lot more in common. you know her parents are little people?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Oh, small world. So little people can have not little people children?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Oh yeah, and vice versa. Mother Nature's a mad scientist, Jerry." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="So you won't believe what happened with Whatley today. It got back to hime that I made this little dentist joke and he got all offended. Those people can be so touchy." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Those people, listen to yourself." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="What?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="You think that dentists are so different from me and you? They came to this country just like everybody else, in search of a dream." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Kramer, he's just a dentist." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah, and you're an anti-dentite." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="I am not an anti-dentite!" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="You're a rabid anti-dentite! Oh, it starts with a few jokes and some slurs. &quot;Hey, denty!&quot; Next thing you know you're saying they should have their own schools." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="They do have their own schools!" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah!" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="One little baby, whatever you have in stock." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Miss Benes..." name="AGENT" /><char dialog="Look it, look it, Ryan. These people are gettin' a baby. Period. Now we can do this the easy way, or we can do this the fun way." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Jerry, I'm sorry to bother you, but you always said you'd be there for me." name="BETH" /><char dialog="Well, what's wrong?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I'm thinking of leaving Arnie." name="BETH" /><char dialog="Talk to me." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="He met with Elaine, and I asked him what happened, and he yada yada'd me. I mean, could he be having an affair?" name="BETH" /><char dialog="Well, I wouldn't put anything past anybody." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="But we just got married." name="BETH" /><char dialog="Well obviously that was a mistake. You need to forget about Arnie. The important thing is you're moving on." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Why would Elaine do that to me?" name="BETH" /><char dialog="Forget about Elaine. Let's just focus on us. Come on, big hug. (Mickey and Karen enter)" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Hey Jerry. Where's Kramer? I've got exciting news." name="MICKEY" /><char dialog="I'm kinda in the middle of something." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Karen and I are getting married." name="MICKEY" /><char dialog="Oh, congratulations. Her marriage just fell apart." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="(To Beth) How many is that for you?" name="MICKEY" /><char dialog="Two." name="BETH" /><char dialog="You're a lightweight. Come on, honey." name="MICKEY" /><char dialog="Hey Jerry. What are you doing here with Beth?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Beth and Arnie broke up." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="So they don't want a baby?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="(Shaking his head no) Pff." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="(Realizes her mistake) I think I'm gonna be sick. (George enters alone)" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Hey, where's Marcy?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="She, uh, went shopping for some shoes for the wedding and, yada yada yada, I'll see her in six to eight months. (Kramer and Julie enter)" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Hey, Kramer, over here." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I just assume not sit next to you." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Kramer... Oh look, there's Mickey and his parents." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Nice looking family." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Very handsome." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="(To Mr. Abbott) How ya doing?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Hey Kramer." name="MR. ABBOTT" /><char dialog="Oh Mickey. Excuse me, I can't take this. (She exits quickly)" name="JULIE" /><char dialog="Hi, Mr. Abbott." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="That's Dr. Abbott, D.D.S. Tim Whatley was one of my students. And if this wasn't my son's wedding day, I'd knock you teeth out you anti-dentite bastard." name="MR. ABBOTT" /><char dialog="What was that all about?" name="BETH" /><char dialog="Oh, I said something about dentists and it got blown all out of proportion." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Hey, what do you call a doctor who fails out of med school?" name="BETH" /><char dialog="What?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="A dentist. (They laugh)" name="BETH" /><char dialog="That's a good one. Dentists." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah, who needs 'em? Not to mention the Blacks and the Jews. (Jerry fakes a smile)" name="BETH" /><char dialog="Where's Beth?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="She went out to get her head shaved." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="We are gathered her today to unite this couple in holy... matrimony." name="FATHER" /><char dialog="Those wisdom teeth are tough to get out." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Marriage is not an intervention to be entered lightly... Yada yada yada, I pronounce you man and wife. (They kiss, walk toward exit)" name="FATHER" /><char dialog="(To Kramer) I really wanted you." name="KAREN" /><char dialog="" name="THE END" /></root>
