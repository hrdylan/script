<root><char dialog="Written by Larry David" name="THE DEAL" /><set>(Comedy club)</set><char dialog="I've been watching women in the department stores. They're trying on clothes, and I've noticed that they do it differently from men. Women don't try on the clothes, they get behind the clothes, you see? They take a dress off the rack, and they hold it up against themself. They can tell something from this. They stick one leg way out 'cause they nedd to know, if some day I'm one-legged, and at a fourty-five degree angle, what am I gonna wear? You never see a man do that. You never see a guy take a suit off the rack, put his head in the neck, and go, &quot;What do you think about this suit? I think I'll get it. Yeah, it looks fine. Put some shoes by the bottom of the pants, I wanna make sure. Yeah, perfect. And what if I'm walking? Move the shoes, move the shoes, move the shoes, move the shoes." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="What are you doing? All right, all right. What's the matter with that? What about that one?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Robert Vaughn, The Helsinki Formula?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="He was good in Man From Uncle." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Guess whose birthday's comin' up soon?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="I know, I'm having my root canal the same week." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Oh, right. I hope you have a good oral surgeon because that can be very serious. (Changes channel) Hey, look at naked people." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="No, I don't wanna see the naked people." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Been a while?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="I have a vague recollection of doing something with someone, but it was a long, long time ago." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I think my last time was in Rochester. My hair was a lot shorter." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="I remember that it's a good thing. Someday, I hope to do it again. (Jerry looks at Elaine)" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="What?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="What?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="What was that look?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="What look?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="The look you just gave me." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="I gave a look?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yes." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="What kind of look?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I know that look." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Then what was it?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Why should I tell you?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Well, you're the big look expert. I wanna see how smart you are." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Trust me. I know the look. (Pause) So..." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="What?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="What about the look?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="I don't know." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="You got something on your mind?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="No. Things pop into your head. You?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Things occur to me from time to time." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Yeah, me too. Well, you can't expect to just forget the past completely." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No, of course not." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="I mean, it was something we did. Probably about, what? Twenty-five times?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Thirty-seven." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Yeah, we pretty much know what we're doin' in there. (Points to bedroom)" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="We know the terrain." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="No big surprises." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Nope." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="What do you think?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I don't know. What do you think?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Well, it's something to consider." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="I mean, let's say we did." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="What if." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Is that like the end of the world or something?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Certainly not." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Why shouldn't we be able to do that once in a while if we want to?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I know." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="I mean, really, what is the big deal? We go in there. (Points to the bedroom) We're in there for a while. We come right back out here. It's not complicated." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="It's almost stupid if we didn't." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="It's moronic." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Absurd!" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Of course, I guess, maybe, some little problems could arise." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="We, there are always a few." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="I mean, if anything happened, and we couldn't be friends the way we are now, that would be really bad." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Devastating." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Because this is very good. (Points back and forth between them to indicate friendship)" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="And that would be good. (Points to bedroom)" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="That would be good too. The idea is combine the this and the that. But this cannot be disturbed." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah, we just wanna take this and add that." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="But of course, we'd have to figure out a way to avoid the things that cause the little problems. Maybe some rules or something." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Huh." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="For example, now, I call you whenever I'm inclined and vice versa." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Right." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="But if we did that, we might feel a certain obligation to call." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Well why should that be? Oh, I have an idea. I have an idea. No call the day after that." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Beautiful. Let's make it a rule." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="All right, sir." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Now here's another little rule. When we see each other now, we retire to our separate quarters. But sometimes, when people get involved with that, they feel pressure to sleep over. When that is not really sleep. Sleep is separate from that. And I don't see why sleep got all tied up and connected with that." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Okay, okay. Spending the night is optional!" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Well now we're gettin' somewhere." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="What about the kiss goodnight?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Tough one. You're call." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="It's brug-wa (?)." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Fine. Well." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Well." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="You ready?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Ready." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="So think you can handle this?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Definitely. (Runs into bookshelf)" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Hey." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Hey." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Got the paper?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Not yet." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No paper?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="I haven't been out yet." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Well, what's taking you so long? (Elaine enters from the bedroom. Kramer is a little shocked) Uh? Oh, well, yeah... (He exits)" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="What's the deal with Aquaman? Could he go on land, or was he just restricted to water?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="No, I think I saw him on land a couple times. So how's the job situation goin'?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Still lookin'. It's pretty bad out there. What about you?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Nothin' much. I slept with Elaine last night." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Oxygen! I need some oxygen! This is major." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I thought you'd like that." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Oh, this is huge!" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I know." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="All right, okay. Let's go, details." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="No, I can't do details." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="You wha?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I can't give details." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No details?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I'm not in the mood." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="You ask me to have lunch, tell me you slept with Elaine, and then say you're not in the mood for details. Now you listen to me. I want details and I want them right now. I don't have a job, I have no place to go. You're not in the mood? Well you get in the mood!" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="All right, okay. We're in the apartment watching TV." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Where are you sitting?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="On the couch." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Next to each other?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="No, separated." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Time?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="About eleven." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Okay, go ahead." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="So she's flipping around the TV, and she gets to the naked station." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Oh, see? that's why I don't have cable in my house. Because of that naked station. If I had that in my house, I would never turn it off. I wouldn't sleep, I wouldn't eat. Eventually, firemen would have to break through the door, they'd find me sitting there in my pajamas with drool coming down my face. All right, all right. So you're watching the naked station." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="And then, somehow, we started talking about, what if we had sex." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Boy, these are really bad details." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="It pains me to say this, but I may be getting to mature for details." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Oh I hate to hear this. That kind of growth really irritates me." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Well. I'll tell you though. It was really passionate." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Better than before?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="She must've taken some kind of seminar or something." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="This is all too much. So what are you feeling? What's going on? Are you like a couple again now?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Not exactly." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Not exactly. What does that mean?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Well, we've tried to arrange a situation where we'll be able to do this once in a while and still be friends. (George laughs hysterically and stands oiut of his seat)" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Where are you living? Are you here? Are you on this planet? It's impossible. It can't be done." name="GEORGE" /><sd>(He sits back down) Thousands of years people have been trying to have their cake and eat it too. So all of a sudden the two of you are going to come along and do it. Where do you get the ego? No one can do it. It can't be done.</sd><char dialog="I think we've worked out a system." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Oh, you know what you're like? You're like a pathetic gambler. You're one of those losers in Las Vegas who keeps thinking he's gonna come up with a way to win at blackjack." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="No, this is very advanced. We've designed at set of rules that we can maintain the friendship by advancing all of the relationship pitfalls." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Sure, all right. Tell me the rules." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Okay. No calls the next day." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="(To himself) So you're havin' the sex, next day you don't have to call. That's pretty good. (Back to Jerry) Go ahead." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="You ready for the second one?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I have tell you, I'm pretty impressed with the first one." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Spending the night. Optional." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No, you see? You got greedy." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="No, that's the rule. It's optional." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I know less about women than anyone in the world. But one thing I do know is they're not happy if you don't spend the night. I could be a hot, sweaty room with no air conditioning and all they have is a little army cot this wide (Displays with French fry) You're not going anywhere." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I think you're wrong." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I hope I am." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Is this yours or the roommate's?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="The roommate's." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Would she mind?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="She keeps track of everything." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Well, that's too bad, 'cause I'm takin' it." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Thanks." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Well, guess I'll get going." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Oh." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Well, I have that root canal tomorrow morning. It'll be easier if I go home." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Fine, go away." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="I don't understand. Is there a problem? (Elaine is pulling a roll of paper towels about twenty feet long) I'm getting the impression there's a problem." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Just go." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="I'm having surgery tomorrow." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Oh, surgery. You're going to the dentist." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="But you said, it can be very serious." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Okay, so fine. Go." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="What happened to the rules? Remember? Sleeping over was optional." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah, it's my house, it's my option." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="It has nothing to do with whose house it is." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Oh, of course it does. (Elaine's roommate, Tina, enters)" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Hi." name="TINA" /><char dialog="Hi." name="ELAINE + JERRY" /><char dialog="Hi, Jerry." name="TINA" /><char dialog="Hi." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Such a great improv class tonight." name="TINA" /><char dialog="Oh really?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="I had this improv where I pretended I was working in one of those booths. You know, in the amusement park, where you have to shoot the water in the clown's mouth and you have to blow up the balloon." name="TINA" /><char dialog="Uh, Tina? Could you excuse us for just one second?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Oh, yeah. I'll excuse you. (She walks away)" name="TINA" /><char dialog="What are you doing?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="I can't go if you're mad." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I'm not mad." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="You seemed a little mad." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No, no. Jerry, I'm fine really. It's okay." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="So you're okay with everything?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Definitely. Are you?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Definitely. Well, goodnight." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Goodn-- (He starts to kiss her) What're you doing?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="What?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Rules." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Hey, who took my cake? (Jerry exits quickly)" name="TINA" /><char dialog="What about jewelry? That's very nice gift." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="No, no. I have to be very careful here. I don't want to send the wrong message. Especially after the other night." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Maybe I'll get her some jewelry." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="No, no. You can't get her anything better than me. Whatever I spend, you have to spend half." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="What am I supposed to get, a bazooka?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="You don't understand. I'm in a very delicate position. Whatever I give her, she's going to be bringing in experts from all over the country to interpret the meaning behind it." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="What does she need? Maybe there's something that she needs." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I think I heard her say something about a bench." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="A bench? What kind of a bench?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I don't know, but she mentioned a bench." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="What, like at a bus stop?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I don't know." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Like a park bench?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I have no idea." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Who puts a bench in their house?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Forget the bench." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I got it. You wanna get her something nice? How 'bout a music box?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="No, too relationshippy. She opens it up, she hears that Laura's theme, I'm dead." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Okay, what about a nice frame? With a picture of another guy in it. Frame says I care for you, but if you wanna get serious, perhaps you'd be interested in someone like this." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Nice looking fellow." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="What about candle holders?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Too romantic." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Lingerie?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Too sexual." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Waffle maker." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Too domestic." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Bust of Nelson Rockefeller." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Too Gubernatorial. (?)" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Let's work on the card." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Maybe you won't like it." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Oh, how could I not like it? Of course I'll like it." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="You could not like it." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Just the fact that you remembered means everything." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Of course I remembered. You reminded me everyday for two months. Oh, the card. (She opens)" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Cash?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Would do you think?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="You got me cash?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Well this way I figure you can go out and get yourself whatever you want. No good?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Who are you, my uncle?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Well come on. That's $182 right there. I don't think that's anything to sneeze at." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Let me see the card. (Reading) To a wonderful girl, a great pal, and more? (Kramer enters)" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Hey. Oh, Elaine. I'm glad you're here. Stay right there. I'm gonna be right back. (He exits)" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Pal? You think I'm your pal?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="I said, &quot;and more.&quot;" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I am not your pal." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="What's wrong with pal? Why is everyone so down on pal? (Kramer enters with present)" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Oh, what is this? You got me something?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Yeah. Open it." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Oh Kramer... (She opens it) The bench! You got me the bench that I wanted! (Jerry looks irritated)" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="That's pretty good, huh?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Great." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Remember when we were standing there and she mentioned it? I made a mental note of it." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Well goody for you." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Oh yeah, I'm very sensitive about that. I mean, when someone's birthday comes up, I keep my ears open. So what'd you get her?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="182 bucks." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Cash? You gotta be kidding. What kind of gift is that? That's like something her uncle would get her." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="(Reading card) Think where man's glory most begins and ends and say my glory was I had such a friend." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="(To Jerry) Yates." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Oh Kramer. (They embrace)" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Could you excuse us please?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="What?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="We're talking." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Oh, the relationship. (He leaves)" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="You know, we never had one fight before this deal." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I know." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Never." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Ever." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="We got along beautifully." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Like clams." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="It was wonderful." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="A pleasure." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="So I think we should just forget the whole deal, and go back to being friends." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I can't do it." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="You what?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I can't do that." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="You mean it's... (She nods) No this. No that. No this or that. Oh, boy. What do you want?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="This, that, and the other." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Oh, sure. Of course, you're entitled. Who doesn't want this, that, and the other?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="You." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="(Starts to correct then realizes) Well..." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Those birthdays. I told you. They're relationship killers. If a relationship is having any problems whatsoever, a birthday will always bring it out." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I never should have made up those rules." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="What is it about sex that just disrupts everything? Is it the touching? Is it the nudity?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="It can't be the nudity. I never got into these terrible fights and misunderstandings when I was changing before gym class." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="You know what this means? I can't see her anymore either." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Why?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="It's break up by association. Besides, she's mad at me anyway because of my birthday present." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="What did you end up giving her?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="91 dollars." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Sorry about that." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="So what're you gonna do?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Well, if I call her, there's no joking around anymore. This is pretty much it." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="So, maybe this should be it." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Could be it." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="She seems like an it." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="She's at it as you get. Imagine bumping into her on the street in five years with a husband. And she tells me he's a sculptor, they live in Vermont..." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="We'd have to kill him." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="We'd get caught, I'd get the chair." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I'd go to prison as your accomplice. I'd have to wear that really heavy denim. Go to the cafeteria line with the guy who slops those mashed potatoes onto your plate. Go to the bathroom in front of hundreds of people." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Plus, you know what else." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="You better call her." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Hey." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Hey." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="You got the paper yet?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Yeah." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Well where is it? (Elaine enters from bedroom with newspaper) Hey, you done with that?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="No." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Well, you're not reading it now." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="All right, you can take it. But I want it back." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Oh yeah. So, ah, what're you guys gonna do today?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Ah, this. And that." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="And the other." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Boy, I really liked the two of you much better when you weren't a couple.
