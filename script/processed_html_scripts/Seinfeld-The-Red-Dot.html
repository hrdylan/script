How could you tell her? I told you not to say anything." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I didn't tell her you stupid idiot. She tricked you." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Elaine you don't understand. I had 103 temperature when I bought that sweater. I was so dizzy I was seeing red dots everywhere. I thought everything in the store had a red dot on it. I couldn't distinguish one red dot from another. I couldn't afford anything. I have nothing. I haven't worked for a really long time. (Jerry is standing right behind George. Jerry takes out a hankerchief and starts fake-crying in it.) I mean look, I have no clothes, look at what I'm wearing. It's just a little red dot." name="GEORGE" /><sd>At the office.</sd><char dialog="This is for you." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Oh, Georgie, you bought this for me?

I asked if I could have it, and he said &quot;No. Get away from me.&quot; Then he started walk away. But I grabbed onto his leg screaming for him to give me the sweater and he dragged me through the street. And then he kicked at me with the other foot and threw some change at me. Oh, but I didn't want the change Georgie. I wanted the cashmere." name="LADY" /><char dialog="I had a feeling you would like it.
