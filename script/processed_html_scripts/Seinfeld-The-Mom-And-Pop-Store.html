He wanted your address - you, my friend, are going to be invited to his night-before-Thanksgiving party. (Elaine raises her hands triumphantly, then gleefully struts her way to the kitchen.)

Let me tell you something. If my Mom and Pop ran a store, I wouldn't shop there." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Hey, Bogambo - they've been in the neighborhood for 48 years. Now, come on, Jerry.

We're going to take a little break now; when we come back, you'll have three more chances to win a spot holding a rope under Woody Woodpecker." name="DJ ON RADIO" /><char dialog="Could you identify the next song? Could you? Could you?" name="MR. PITT" /><char dialog="Mr. Pitt, why would you want to hold onto the ropes on the Woody Woodpecker balloon?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="My father was a stern man. He forbad us to participate in any activities that he thought were associated with the common man. The Thanksgiving Day Parade was first on the list." name="MR. PITT" /><char dialog="Oh. Alright, I'll do the best I can. (Turns up the radio.)" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Alright, here we go for the next spot under the balloon. If you know the name of this song, call 555-BAND.

You don't think he really owned this car?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I don't know." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Well, why would the guy make up something like that? Of all the names he could pick, why settle on Jon Voight?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Don't you see, that's the genius of it. If he had said Liam Neeson, you'd know he's making it up." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Neeson? How are you comparing Liam Neeson with Jon Voight? Jerry, we're talking about Joe Buck.

So what am I supposed to wear?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Jerry, I left you a pair right here...(goes into Jerry's room and comes out with a pair of cowboy boots.) C'mon.

Oh, I can't wear these! (Stands up.) They look ridiculous!" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Ah, you look like a cowboy! Huh?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="But I don't wanna be a cowboy!" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Oh, stop it. You know that friend of yours, Tim the dentist?

See if she can find out anything from Tim Whatley." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Hey. I got Jon Voight's LeBaron.

Pencil." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Hey...you don't think...sure, that's Jon Voight's pencil!" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="With Jon Voight's teeth marks. (Looks at the owner's manual.) Owner's manual...you know what? This car was owned by Jon Voight." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Ah! See? I told ya." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Except Jon is spelled with an H. J-O-H-N." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="So?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Doesn't Jon Voight spell his name J-O-N?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="So, what are you saying?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Nothing. I'm sure &quot;Jon&quot; probably mispelled his own name. I know sometimes I spell Jerry with a G...and an I!

Yeah, you better run!" name="TOUGH GUY" /><sd>Commercial break.</sd><sd>Jerry, George and Elaine at Jerry's apartment.</sd><char dialog="Did they take anything?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="No, they didn't even touch me.

(Elaine gives Jerry a cold cloth for his jaw.) You know, maybe his name really is J-O-H-N, but he changed it to J-O-N for show business. Well, you know, J-O-N is a lot zippier." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Yeah, that's possible." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="How would you find out something like that...wait a minute, what am I thinking? I've got the entire Yankee organization at my disposal." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="He'll dispose of it." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Heh, that's right. See ya later. (Exits.)" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="So Jerome, I did a little snooping around for you." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Ah! What'd you find out, Lois?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Well, I talked to Tim Whatley..." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Yeah..." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="And I asked him, &quot;Should Jerry bring anything?&quot;" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="So...?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Mmmm...and he said, &quot;Why would Jerry bring anything?&quot;" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Alright, but let me ask you this question." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="What?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Which word did he emphasize? Did he say, &quot;Why would Jerry bring anything?&quot; or, &quot;Why would Jerry bring anything?&quot; You emphasize &quot;Jerry&quot; or &quot;bring.&quot;" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I think he emphasized &quot;would.&quot;" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="You know what?

The place was empty. Everything is gone. Mom and Pop - vrooop - vanished." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="So all my sneakers are gone?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I'm afraid so. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. I've been asking around - they didn't even have any kids." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Mom and Pop aren't even a Mom and Pop?!" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="It was all an act, Jerry. They conned us, and they scored, big time." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="So. Mom and Pop's plan was to move into the neighborhood...establish trust...for 48 years. And then, run off with Jerry's sneakers." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Apparently." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Alright, that's enough of this." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Where ya goin'?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I gotta go to the Dixieland Deli to pick up Mr. Pitt's security pass for the parade." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Why does he want to hold a rope underneath Woody Woodpecker in the Thanksgiving Day Parade?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="He finds his laugh &quot;intoxicating.&quot; (Laughs like Woody Woodpecker, and exits.)" name="ELAINE" /><sd>George in a meeting at Yankee stadium.</sd><char dialog="So George, what kind of promotional events are we talking about?" name="MR.

Taxi." name="VOIGHT" /><char dialog="Hey! Jon Voight! Jon Voight! (Voight waves at Kramer and hurriedly gets in the cab. Kramer runs over to the car.) Hey, listen, can I ask you something? Listen, listen...(Leans in the the open back window of the cab. Defensively, Voight grabs Kramer's arm and bites it. Kramer screams. The cab speeds off leaving Kramer in the street, stunned.)" name="KRAMER" /><sd>Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment.</sd><char dialog="No Jon Voight Day, huh?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No. Now I'll always have this doubt about the car. What, your jaw still hurts?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Yeah, it's all swollen. I think I may have chipped a tooth when I fell yesterday." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="You should have somebody take a look at that." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="I'm calling dentists all day here, there's nobody working the day before Thanksgiving." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="You going to the party?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="No, I don't know if I'm invited." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Well, there's going to be a lot of dentists there." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Yeah, you're right." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="You don't want to suffer with this all weekend." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Yeah, I gotta see a dentist, this is killin' me. Well, I'll take a chance.

Hey, so'd you find my sneakers yet?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No. (To George) But I did run into somebody you might be interested in, a Mr. Jon Voight, the actor?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Jon Voight! Are you kiddin' me? Did you talk to him?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Well, he was a little standoffish." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="What, you didn't ask him about the car?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="No, I couldn't, his cab pulled away. But he did, however, make an impression on me. (Pulls up his sleeve and shows George his arm.) Look." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="What?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="His tooth marks. He bit me." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Jon Voight bit you?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Well, what is he, a vampire?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No, it's justifiable. He thought I was going for his wallet." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="He left perfect imprints." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="That he did. Now, you got that pencil with the bite marks on it?
