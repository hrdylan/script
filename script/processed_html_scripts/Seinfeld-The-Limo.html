You don't like it;</sd><sd>go back to your own country. I think the whole airport airline complex is a</sd><sd>huge scam just to sell the tuna sandwiches. I think that profit is what's</sd><sd>supporting the whole air travel industry. I mean think about it; the terminals,</sd><sd>the airplanes, it's all just a distraction so that you don't notice the beating</sd><sd>that you're taking on the tuna.</sd><sd>George is at the airport.</sd><char dialog="It's all departures.

The way you" name="EVA" /><sd>analyzed the game? The way you identify the major players? Well it left me</sd><sd>breathless. You're a brilliant, brilliant man.</sd><char dialog="Well, it's just a game. Remember that, kids." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Just a game. He's so humble.

Anything." name="EVA" /><sd>Tim returns.</sd><char dialog="Nothing to worry about, it was just a flat tire. But rest assured, we're" name="TIM" /><sd>prepared to handle anything that might come up.</sd><sd>Tim opens a briefcase filled with firearms.

The reclusive Mr. O'Brien is an advocate of the violent</sd><sd>overthrow of the government. He has openly professed a deep admiration of Adolf</sd><sd>Hitler. Even David Duke has denounced him as a dangerous extremist. There is a</sd><sd>full house inside awaiting his arrival from the airport. Sources tell me he is</sd><sd>in route and should be arriving momentarily. Police have set up barricades, but</sd><sd>quite frankly Bill and Jean, I don't think they're any match for the emotional</sd><sd>fuse that has been lit here tonight. Reporting from the Paramount, I'm Jodi</sd><sd>Baskerville, back to you in the studio.</sd><sd>Cut back to Kramer and Elaine on the corner.</sd><char dialog="Something's very strange. George goes to the airport to pick up Jerry." name="KRAMER" /><sd>They come back in a limo with four tickets to the basketball game and wanna be</sd><sd>called O'Brien and Murphy? O'Brien.

The head of" name="DAN" /><sd>the Aryan Union is speaking, he's in from Chicago. You should come.</sd><char dialog="Oh, can't, I'm going to the Knicks-Bulls game." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Oh, well that's where the rally is. The Paramount, right next door." name="DAN" /><char dialog="Oh, well, maybe we'll run into you." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Yeah, yeah ok. It's really gonna be something, this is the first time" name="DAN" /><sd>he's ever appeared in public, no one even knows what he looks like.</sd><char dialog="Who?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="The head of the Aryan Union; O'Brien." name="DAN" /><sd>Cut back to the limo.

A Nazi!" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I know, I know. Kind of a cute Nazi though." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Well we gotta make a plan before they come back, what are we gonna do?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I don't know." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="Let's just make a run for it." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I can't run, I have a bad hamstring." name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="How'd that happen?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I hurt it in a hotel room. You know where they tuck the covers in real" name="GEORGE" /><sd>tight in those hotel rooms? I can't sleep like that so I tried to kick it out</sd><sd>and I pulled it.</sd><char dialog="I know, why do they make that bed so tight? You gotta sleep with your" name="JERRY" /><sd>feet like that.</sd><char dialog="For a mental patient. Wait a minute, the phone, we'll call the police." name="GEORGE" /><sd>George grabs the phone and dials.</sd><char dialog="9... 1... 1. She said she'd do anything. Hello, police? Uh, yeah" name="GEORGE" /><sd>listen, we're in the back of a limo in Queens--</sd><sd>Tim re-enters the limo.</sd><char dialog="--Astroturf? You know who's responsible for that, don't you?! The" name="GEORGE" /><sd>Jews! Ah, the Jews hate grass. They always have, they always will.</sd><char dialog="We'll be ready in a minute." name="TIM" /><char dialog="Would you excuse us for a minute Tim boy, we're kind of in the middle" name="GEORGE" /><sd>of something.</sd><char dialog="With all due respect, Mr. O'Brien, we're just about to leave." name="TIM" /><char dialog="Tim, who's the head of the Aryan Union, you or me?" name="GEORGE" /><char dialog="You are." name="TIM" /><char dialog="And who's responsible for making hate mongering and fascism popular" name="GEORGE" /><sd>again?</sd><char dialog="You are." name="TIM" /><char dialog="Good.

We wait till we get to your street corner, we see" name="GEORGE" /><sd>Elaine and Kramer then we get out. They can't shoot us in the city.</sd><char dialog="Nah. No one's ever been shot in the city." name="JERRY" /><sd>Cut back to Elaine and Kramer on the corner.</sd><char dialog="I'm telling you, something's going on. I can feel it, sense it." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="I'm sure he was just joking around." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Oh no no no, this is no joke. O'Brien's coming in from Chicago," name="KRAMER" /><sd>Jerry's in a limo, says he's O'Brien? That's not funny. Oh my god. Yes. Yes!</sd><char dialog="What is it?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Don't you see? There's always been something very strange about Jerry," name="KRAMER" /><sd>always so clean and organized. Do I have to spell it out for you? The limo?</sd><sd>The name? The rally at Madison Square Garden? Jerry, O'Brien are the same</sd><sd>person. Jerry is the leader of the Aryan Union!</sd><char dialog="Jerry's a nazi?!" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="I can't believe I didn't see it." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="Listen, you idiot!

'Tis a beautiful country</sd><sd>though; lush rolling hills, and the peat, ah the peat.</sd><char dialog="Sounds more like Scottish." name="TIM" /><char dialog="We were right on the border." name="JERRY" /><sd>Cut back to the street corner.</sd><char dialog="Maybe he's with the company." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="What?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="The CIA! Maybe they placed him in there to infiltrate the organization" name="KRAMER" /><sd>from within.</sd><char dialog="What about his comedy act?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="That's the perfect cover! All that time on the road? Look Jerry, he's" name="KRAMER" /><sd>too normal to be a comedian. These comedians, they're sick, neurotic people.</sd><char dialog="What about George?" name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="What about him, he's part of it. His whole personality is a disguise." name="KRAMER" /><sd>No real person can act the way he does. Elaine, I'm telling you they're with</sd><sd>the organization. They're all part of it. He's in there with Helms and Hunt</sd><sd>and Liddy, that whole crowd.

The police seem" name="JODI" /><sd>unable or unwilling to control the crowd, I would imagine Mr. O'Brien must be</sd><sd>having some very grave doubts if he made the right choice for his first public</sd><sd>appearance.</sd><sd>Cut back to the limo. The explanations are becoming more heated and less</sd><sd>understandable, the limo is rocking violently and Tim and Eva are becoming</sd><sd>unnerved.</sd><char dialog="Get out!!" name="EVA" /><char dialog="Look, it's Dan!
