<root><char dialog="Written by Peter Mehlman" name="THE WIFE" /><set>(Comedy club)</set><sd>Of all the places that you go all the time, the dry-cleaning relationship is one of the most bizarre. Because you keep giving each other the same thing, back and forth, over and over again. He gives it to you, you give it to him, he gives it back to you. It's like it's half his shirt, in a way. He has it as much as you do...you oughta go shopping with him. 'What do you think of this shirt?' 'That would look good with a light starch.' The only warning label people really respect is 'dry-clean only.' Y'know what I mean? Speed limits, lung cancer, cigarette warnings - your very life is at stake! People go, 'Ah, the hell with it!' But dry-clean only? 'Oh, don't put that in the wash! It's dry-clean only! Are you crazy?!'</sd><sd>Opening scene - Jerry and his girlfriend Meryl at Jerry's apartment.

We've always just kind've pecked. This one had a totally different dynamic." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Really." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah.

Definite moisture." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="That's an open-lip kiss, alright." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Yeah.
