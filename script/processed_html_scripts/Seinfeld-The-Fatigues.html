He is a disaster." name="ELAINE" /><char dialog="Well, if he's doing that bad, maybe he's in line for another promotion." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="You know what? You are exactly right. That is what I should do, I" name="ELAINE" /><sd>should promote him.

It's an acquired taste, yeah." name="KRAMER" /><sd>Kramer bites into one and spits it out.</sd><char dialog="Did you follow the recipe?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="The recipe was for four to six people; I had to multiply for a hundred" name="KRAMER" /><sd>and eighty-three people. I guess I got confused.</sd><char dialog="It tastes like dirt." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Well I also dropped it on the way over. Look I'm in trouble, I got no" name="KRAMER" /><sd>skills. I can't peel, I can't chop, I can't grate. I can't mince! I got no</sd><sd>sense of flavor, obviously. You know, I gotta talk to Frank.</sd><char dialog="Kramer, you can't talk to Frank." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="No I gotta talk to him, I know that he can help me, Jerry." name="KRAMER" /><sd>Abby walks in.</sd><char dialog="I think there's a dead animal in the elevator." name="ABBY" /><char dialog="My stuffed cabbage!" name="KRAMER" /><sd>Kramer runs out.</sd><char dialog="So, great dinner last night." name="ABBY" /><char dialog="Yeah, it was alright." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="I told Cynthia we'd double with her and Banya Saturday and then catch his" name="ABBY" /><sd>act.</sd><char dialog="No. No, no way, no Banya." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="What?" name="ABBY" /><char dialog="Have you seen his act? He's got a twelve-minute bit about Ovaltine." name="JERRY" /><sd>He's a punk, a patsy, a hack.</sd><char dialog="Cynthia would not date a hack." name="ABBY" /><char dialog="Would. Does.

Hey!!" name="ELAINE" /><sd>George is in his office at Yankee stadium, he pushes 'play' on a cassette</sd><sd>recorder. The voice on the tape sounds exactly like George.</sd><char dialog="Chapter one. In order to manage risk we must first understand risk." name="VOICE" /><sd>How do you spot risk?

Stop it!" name="GEORGE" /><sd>Kramer is at Frank's.</sd><char dialog="C'mon Frank, I need you. I mean the war was fifty years ago." name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="In my mind, there's a war still going on." name="FRANK" /><char dialog="Alright, what happened, Frank? What is it that you can't get over?" name="KRAMER" /><sd>Frank pours a shot of whiskey and drinks it.</sd><char dialog="Inchon, Korea, 1950. I was the best cook Uncle Sam ever saw, slinging" name="FRANK" /><sd>hash for the Fighting 103rd. As we marched north, our supply lines were getting</sd><sd>thin. One day a couple of GIs found a crate, inside were six hundred pounds of</sd><sd>prime Texas steer. At least it once was prime. The Use date was three weeks</sd><sd>past, but I was arrogant, I was brash, I thought if I used just the right</sd><sd>spices, cooked it long enough...</sd><char dialog="What happened?" name="KRAMER" /><char dialog="I went too far. I over seasoned it. Men were keeling over all around" name="FRANK" /><sd>me. I can still hear the retching, the screaming. I sent sixteen of my own men</sd><sd>to the latrines that night. They were just boys.</sd><char dialog="Frank, you were a boy too. And it was war. It was a crazy time for" name="KRAMER" /><sd>everyone.</sd><char dialog="Tell that to Bobby Colby. All that kid wanted to do was go home. Well" name="FRANK" /><sd>he went home alright, with a crater in his colon the size of a cutlet. Had to</sd><sd>sit him on a cork the eighteen-hour flight home!</sd><char dialog="Frank, now listen to me. Two hundred Jewish singles need you. This is" name="KRAMER" /><sd>your chance to make it all right again.</sd><char dialog="No. No, I'll never cook again! Never! Now get out of my house!! Get" name="FRANK" /><sd>out. Go.</sd><sd>Jerry and Abby are in Jerry's apartment.</sd><char dialog="So you saw Banya's act?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="He got two minutes into that Ovaltine thing and I just couldn't take it" name="ABBY" /><sd>anymore.</sd><char dialog="I told you, it's like getting beaten with a bag of oranges." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Why is he so obsessed with Ovaltine?" name="ABBY" /><char dialog="He just thinks that anything that dissolves in milk is funny." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Anyway, Cynthia and I got into this big argument afterwards and I think" name="ABBY" /><sd>it's over.</sd><char dialog="No more mentor?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Looks that way." name="ABBY" /><char dialog="Well at least you and I are okay again." name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Actually I was kind of thinking that maybe we shouldn't see each other" name="ABBY" /><sd>for a while.</sd><char dialog="Why?" name="JERRY" /><char dialog="Well I'm feeling a little disoriented.

Oh. Well, um, in that case why don't we take the phrase, "kicking in a</sd><sd>skull" and we tweak it, you know, just a hair, to something like, what, like</sd><sd>"strolling through a dewy meadow"?</sd><char dialog="Dewy meadow." name="EDDIE" /><sd>Frank and Estelle are in their kitchen.</sd><char dialog="Here's your omelet." name="ESTELLE" /><char dialog="It's dry." name="FRANK" /><char dialog="That's the way I always make it." name="ESTELLE" /><char dialog="Well it sucks." name="FRANK" /><char dialog="What did you say?" name="ESTELLE" /><char dialog="Your meatloaf is mushy, your salmon croquettes are oily and your" name="FRANK" /><sd>eggplant parmesan is a disgrace to this house!</sd><char dialog="Well that's too bad, because I'm the only one who cooks around here!" name="ESTELLE" /><char dialog="Not any more!
