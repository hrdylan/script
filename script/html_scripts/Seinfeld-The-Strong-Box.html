</b>               George, drinking tea in his apartment with his girlfriend.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I-I've given this a lot of thought. 
               I'm sorry, but we, uh, we have to break 
               up.
<b> 
</b><b>                             MAURA
</b>               No.

<b>                             MAURA
</b>               We're not breaking up.

<b>                             MAURA
</b>               No.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               She said no.

<b>                             JERRY
</b>               What did you do?

<b>                             GEORGE
</b>               What could I do? We fooled around and 
               went to a movie.
<b> 
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               George, both parties don't have to 
               consent to a breakup. It's not like 
               you're launching missiles from a submarine 
               and you both have to turn your keys. 
               Obviously, you didn't make a convincing 
               case. Let me hear your arguments.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Well, I don't really like her.

<b>                             JERRY
</b>               That's good.

<b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I don't find her attractive.

<b>                             JERRY
</b>               Solid.

<b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I'd like to sleep with a lot of other 
               women.
<b> 
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Always popular.

<b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Sometimes at restaurants she talks 
               to her food. 'Oh, Mr. Mashed Potatoes, 
               you are so good.'
<b> 
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You have an airtight case.

<b>                             GEORGE
</b>               And in bed--

<b>                             JERRY
</b>               I'm afraid we're out of time.

<b>                             GEORGE
</b>               What?

<b>                             JERRY
</b>               Check these out. These are Jerry Lewis' 
               old cufflinks that he actually wore 
               in the movie Cinderfella. I got 'em 
               at an auction.
<b> 
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I got some cufflinks I could've loaned 
               you.
<b> 
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               No, Jerry Lewis is gonna be at this 
               Friar's Club roast I'm goin' to next 
               week. Now I have an in to strike up 
               a conversation with him.
<b> 
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               You already have an in. You have the 
               same first name. Jerry.
<b> 
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Oh, that'll intrigue him.

<b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Well, it worked when I met George Peppard 
               last week.
<b> 
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               George Peppard has been dead for years.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Well, whoever he was, he knew a lot 
               about The A-Team.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               based on the method of execution?

<b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Right, right. I mean, if I was getting 
               the chair, I'd go for something hot 
               and spicy. You know, thai, maybe Mexican. 
               Lethal injection, feels like pasta. 
               You know, painless, don't want anything 
               to heavy.
<b> 
</b><b>                             GLENN
</b>               So, um, why don't we get together some 
               time?
<b> 
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Oh, sure. Why don't you give me your 
               number?
<b> 
</b><b>                             GLENN
</b>               I think it'd be better if I called 
               you.
<b> 
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Oh. OK. Maybe we could grab some lunch 
               sometime. Do-do you work around here?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GLENN
</b>               Mmmm... no, not really.

<b>                             ELAINE
</b>               So, is there anything you can tell 
               me about yourself?
<b> 
</b><b>                             GLENN
</b>               I think you're very beautiful.

<b>                             ELAINE, LAUGHING
</b>               Oh, ha ha. That'll do.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I haven't talked to him in, like, three 
               weeks. I think it might be over.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               So, what's this guy about?

<b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I don't know. He wouldn't tell me his 
               phone number, where he worked. I'll 
               be he's in a relationship.
<b> 
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Or he's a crime fighter safeguarding 
               his secret identity. Elaine, you could 
               be dating the Green Lantern!
<b> 
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Which one is he?

<b>                             JERRY
</b>               Green suit, power ring.

<b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I don't care for jewellery on men.

</b>               Kramer, entering Jerry's apartment carrying a large box.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Hey. It happened again. Another robbery 
               in the building.
<b> 
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               So you bought a cooler?

<b>                             KRAMER
</b>               It's a strongbox to protect my irreplacables.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               And... what would those be?

<b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Some taxidermy that's been in my family 
               for generations. My Tony, my... military 
               discharge.
<b> 
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You were in the Army?

<b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Briefly. Now, I gotta find a good place 
               to hide this key. Because if somebody 
               finds this, they hold the key to all 
               my possessions.
<b> 
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Literally.

<b>                             KRAMER
</b>               'Literally'? What's that supposed to 
               mean? You mind if I hide this somewhere?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               No, go ahead.

<b>                             JERRY
</b>               Oh, come on!

<b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Come on, Jerry, this is a security 
               issue. Boy, you wouldn't last a day 
               in the Army.
<b> 
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Well, that's classified.

<b>                             JERRY
</b>               Kramer?

<b>                             ELAINE
</b>               No, the Green Lantern.

<b>                             KRAMER
</b><b>               OK!
</b>
<b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Well, I don't know. I may never marry. 
               It might be the closest I get.
<b> 
</b>               (Jerry, getting a spoon out of his silverware drawer, accidentally 
               stumbles on the key, and holds it up for Kramer to see)
<b> 
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               You peeked!

<b>                             JERRY
</b>               This is your hiding place?!

<b>                             KRAMER
</b>               It was under a spoon!

<b>               
</b>               officially broken up. Thank you, and good night.

<b>                             MAURA
</b>               No, George, we're not.

<b>                             GEORGE
</b>               But I proved it!

<b>                             MAURA
</b>               I refuse to give up on this relationship. 
               It's like launching
<b> 
</b>               missiles from a submarine. Both of use have to turn our keys.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Well, then, I am gonna have to ask 
               you to turn your key.
<b> 
</b><b>                             MAURA
</b>               I'm sorry, George, I can't do that.

<b> 
</b><b>

<b>                             ELAINE

<b>                             ELAINE, IN HER MIND

<b>                             ELAINE

<b>                             ELAINE

<b>                             JERRY
</b>               There's been some robberies in the

<b> 
</b><b>                             PHIL

</b><b>               
</b>               key.

<b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Sounds like a scam.

</b><b>                             JERRY

<b>                             ELAINE

               used to urinate on our garbage

<b>                             JERRY
</b>               Good. How did you handle that?

<b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Well, we gave him a few bucks, and... 
               now he goes in the alley
<b> 
</b>               across the street.

<b>                             JERRY
</b>               Same situation. Pay him off, and you're 
               clean.
<b> 
</b><b>                             ELAINE

<b> 
</b>               Wh-what am I supposed to do, just walk into his hovel, and hand 
               him... well,
<b> 
</b>               how much do you think it would be?

<b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Seeing Maura. Apparently, I was unable 
               to break up beyond a

<b>                             JERRY
</b>               That strange Portuguese guy that lives

</b><b>

</b>               Kramer, they think I killed Fredo!

<b> 
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Yeah. Just give it to the Portuguese 
               guy, and he... puts it in the
<b> 
</b>               incinerator.

<b>                             JERRY
</b>               Just get the key and let's get out

<b> 
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               You know, it's a funny thing about 
               that bird dying. I hid the key in
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Fredo's food dish. Whew! That's a weird coincidence.

<b>                             JERRY
</b>               Kramer!?

<b>                             KRAMER

<b>                             JERRY

<b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Fredo was weak and stupid. He shouldn't've

<b> 
</b><b>                             JERRY
