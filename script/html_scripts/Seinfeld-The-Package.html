</b><b>                             DOCTOR 
</b>               Elaine. You shouldn't be reading that.
               So tell me about this rash of yours.

</b><b>                             ELAINE 
</b>               Well it's , it's..... You know I noticed 
               that somebody wrote in my chart that I was
               difficult in January of 92 and I have to tell 
               you that I remember that appointment exactly.
               You see this nurse asked me to put a gown             
               on but it was a mole on my shoulder and I 
               specifically wore a tank top so I wouldn't have
               to put a gown on. You know they're made of paper.

</b>               Well that was a long time ago. How 
               about if I just erase it. Now               
               about that rash...

</b>               All right Miss Benes. This doesn't 
               look too serious. You'll be fine.
