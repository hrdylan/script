</b>               The cosmetic surgery procedures that are available to people 
               today - liposuction, are you familiar with this? This is a fat-sucking 
               machine. Now you know, somewhere, somebody is working on a way 
               that this thing could go into a restaurant. And you could just 
               order it off the menu. 'I tell you what, give me the cheesecake, 
               crank me up to nine, and put a scoop of ice cream on the side.'

</b>               Hi, Sidra. I usually last about ten 
               minutes on a Stairmaster. Unless of 
               course there's someone stretching in 
               front of me in a leotard, then I can 
               go an hour.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Oh, yeah. That's why they call it a 
               Stairmaster. You get up there and you 
               stare.

               take a sauna.

</b>               Yeah. I really like her.

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               You know, uh...they're fake.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               What? Don't say that!

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b>               How do you know?

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I can tell. You know how you're always 
               bragging how you can spot a lesbian?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I'm not bragging, I happen to have a 
               very keen lesbian eye. (A woman walks 
               by Jerry and Elaine.) Hi, how ya doin.' 
               (Jerry jerks a thumb at the woman to 
               confirm his talent. Elaine is skeptical.)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Oh, right. C'mon, don't you think they 
               seem a bit too perfect?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yes, they do!

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I never knew you were so into breasts. 
               I thought you were a leg man.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               A leg man? Why would I be a leg man? 
               I don't need legs. I have legs. Have 
               you ever seen her naked in the locker 
               room?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               No.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Oh, well, then I can't accept your testimony. 
               Maybe if you had seen her naked.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I don't want to see her naked.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Well, I do.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Well, that's your problem.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Look, you made the allegation. The least 
               you could do is follow up.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Jerry, what am I gonna do? I'm gonna 
               go in there and spy on her in the sauna?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yes! Go in there! Do a little investigative 
               journalism. I need to know!
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               But a few more dates and you can find 
               out for yourself!
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Don't be so sure. Look at George - he's 
               on his ninth date with Betsy, he still 
               hasn't gotten anywhere with her.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               What's his problem?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Well, every time he tries to make a 
               move, something screws up. Like on their 
               last date, they were on the couch, but 
               she was sitting on his wrong side.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Wrong side?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yeah, she was on his right side. He 
               can't make a move with his left hand. 
               Can't go left.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               He can't go left.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               No! I'm lefty, can't go right. What 
               about women? Do they go left or right?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Nah, we just play defense.

<b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               New scene - George and Betsy at Betsy's apartment. George tries 
               to make it to the right-hand side of the couch, but Betsy beats 
               him to it.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Can I ask you a question? Would you 
               mind switching seats?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             BETSY
</b>               Oh, actually, I really prefer to sit 
               here. I don't hear very well out of 
               this ear (points to her right ear) so, 
               I always try to sit to the right of 
               people.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I'll shout.

<b>               
</b><b>                             BETSY
</b>               Well, I really think I feel more comfortable 
               here.
<b>

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               C'mon, c'mon...(stands up and physically 
               rolls Betsy to the left side of the 
               couch.) See, now, is that so bad?
<b> 
</b><b>

</b><b>                             BETSY
</b>               But George, what if it's an emergency?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               In the whole world right now, there's 
               maybe three emergencies. Why would you 
               think, on this entire planet, that you're 
               one of those three?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             BETSY
</b>               George, please. (Gets up and answers 
               the phone.) Hello? What? (shocked) Oh 
               my god!
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE

</b>               New scene - Elaine at the health club, in the sauna with Sidra 
               and some other women. We hear her thoughts.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE'S BRAIN
</b>               Boy, I'm really sweatin.' Good sweat, 
               beads of sweat...sweatin' bullets. (Notices 
               Sidra.) Look at her. I don't need to 
               see her naked to know those aren't real. 
               Why does she need to tie the towel around 
               her? She's got a rack on her chest. 
               (Sidra takes her towel off and lies 
               down.) Oh god! Sidra's takin' the towel 
               off! (Looks at Sidra's chest.) Whoa, 
               doctor! That's it, I knew it! I knew 
               it, they're definitely fake.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               Cut back to George and Betsy at her apartment. Betsy's still 
               on the phone.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             BETSY
</b>               So, when's the funeral? Well, Aunt Clarice 
               was so ill, I guess it was really a 
               blessing. (George, on the couch behind 
               Betsy, is impatiently waiting for her 
               to get off the phone so he can continue 
               putting the moves on her. He shrugs, 
               and crosses himself.) Yeah, I'll fly 
               home as soon as I can. (George waves 
               goodbye, and mimics a plane flying through 
               the air with his hand.) O.k. You, too. 
               Get some sleep. (Betsy looks at George, 
               and he manufactures a completely phony 
               look of sorrow.)

</b>               That's like putting your whole mouth 
               right in the dip! From now on, when 
               you take a chip - just take one dip 
               and end it!

               dip that way. (takes a chip.)

               you want to dip...(bites the chip) I'll 
               dip the way I want to dip. (dips the 
               chip again.)

               an untimely stroke, and lost the use 
               of his right hand, so...obviously I 
               was unable to get the death certificate. 
               However, I do have this. (Reaches inside
