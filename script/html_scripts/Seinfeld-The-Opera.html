<b>               
</b>               The idea behind the tuxedo is the woman's point of view that 
               men are all the
<b> 
</b>               same, so we might as well dress them that way. That's why a wedding 
               is like
<b> 
</b>               the joining together of a beautiful glowing bride, and some guy. 
               The tuxedo
<b> 
</b>               is a wedding safety device created by women because they know 
               that men are
<b> 
</b>               undependable. So in case the groom chickens out, everybody just 
               takes one
<b> 
</b>               step over and she marries the next guy. That's why the wedding 
               vow isn't 'do
<b> 
</b>               you take Bill Simpson', its 'do you take this man'.

               Now I'm gonna

               if its good

<b>                             JERRY
</b>               Ooo, that was a bad toast.

<b>                             GEORGE

</b>               I was trying to loosen 'em up a little

<b> 
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               There were old people there, all the 
               relatives. You were like a Red

</b>               Fox record. I mean, at the end of the toast nobody even drank. 
               They were
<b> 
</b>               just standing there, they were just frozen! That might have been 
               one of the

</b>               Alright, still her father didn't have

</b>               The hardest part about being a clown, 
               it seems to me, would be that
<b> 
</b>               you're constantly referred to as a clown. "Who was that clown?", 
               "I'm not
<b> 
</b>               working with that clown, did you hire that clown?", "The guy's 
               a clown!".
<b> 
</b>               How do you even start into being a clown, how do you know that 
               you want to
<b> 
</b>               be a clown, I guess you get to a point where you're pants look 
               so bad, it's
<b> 
</b>               actually easier to become a clown than having the proper alterations 
               done.
<b> 
</b>               Because if you think about it, a clown, if there isn't a circus 
               around them,
<b> 
</b>               is really just a very annoying person. You're in the back seat

<b> 
</b>               'em. These opera kids they're going two-fifty, two-eighty,

               three-twenty-five, they're wearing big white woolly vests, the 
               women have
<b> 
</b>               like the breastplates, the bullet hats with the horn coming out. 
               If you
