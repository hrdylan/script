<b>               
</b><b>                             WILHEM
</b>               I called this meeting because we......have........a 
               problem. For
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               the last few months someone has been stealing equipment from 
               the
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               club. Until recently it's been little things, y'know; bases,
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               batting helmets, donuts, but two nights ago they pulled the big 
               one. 
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               The camera goes back and forth from Wilhem to George who keeps 
               pulling on
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               his collar he's sweating.

<b>               
</b><b>                             WILHEM
</b>               They took a pitching machine, a batting 
               cage ,the in-field tarp and
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               all of Mr Steinbrenner's vitamins.. Now , we have reasons to
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               believe it's an inside job.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (still puffing)Whoa!!

<b>               
</b><b>                             WILHEM

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               that...you come forward.

<b>               
</b>               Wilhem looks at George who's sweating so much it seems he's hiding
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               something.

<b>
