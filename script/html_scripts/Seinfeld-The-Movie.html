               at most movie theaters? Didja

</b><b>

</b>               and eighty, you know what I mean? Like, the girl that sells you 
               the
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               ticket, she's ten. Then there's the guy who rips the ticket, 
               he's a
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               hundred and two. So, what happened in the middle, there? You
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               couldn't find anybody? It's like they want to show you how life
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               comes full circle. You're fifteen, you sell the tickets. Then

               it 
<b>               
</b>               to you. When you're in the theater, you can't find out.
<b>               
</b>               (whispering to imaginary friends seated around him) "Why did 
               they 
<b>               
</b>               kill that guy?... Why did they kill him?... Who was that guy?

<b>

<b>               
</b>               would they kill him if he was with them? Oh, he wasn't *really*
