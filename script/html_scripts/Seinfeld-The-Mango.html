</b>               A female orgasm is kinda like the bat 
               cave. A very few people know where it 
               is and if you're lucky enough to see 
               it you probably don't know how you got 
               there and you can't find you way back 
               after you left.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Nobody does. You know, nobody knows 
               what to do. You just close your eyes 
               and you hope for the best. I really 
               think they're happy if you just make 
               an effort.

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I don't know. Last time I got the tap.
<b> 
</b><b>

</b><b>                             JERRY

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               You know, you're going along, you think 
               everything's all right and all of a 
               sudden you get that tap. (George taps 
               his own shoulder). You know it's like 
               pfffff (whistling sound), all right 
               that's enough, you're through.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               The tap is tough.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               It's like the manager coming out and 
               asking you for the ball.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Well maybe she just wanted to move on 
               to other business.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               No, no, this wasn't moving on. I got 
               the hook. I wish I could get a lesson 
               in that.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               It's a very complicated area.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               You can go crazy trying to figure that 
               place out.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               It's a haaazy mystery.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Anyway, I think everything else is okay. 
               Unless of course she's faking.

               hands in chains! But he had a problem 
               with that. The miracle is that it ever

</b>               It's all George's fault. All that talk 
               about impotence. He got to me. And that 
               orgasm stuff: orgasm this and orgasm 
               that. It's a lot of pressure!
