</b><b>               
</b>               Every time somebody recommends a doctor, he's always the best. 
               "Oh, is he good?" "Oh, he's the best. This guy's the best." They
               can't all be the best. 
<b> 
</b>               There can't be this many bests. Someone's graduating at the bottom 
               of these classes, where are these doctors? Is somewhere, someone saying 
               to their friend, "You should see my doctor, he's the worst. Oh yeah,
               he's the worst, he's the absolute worst there is. Whatever you've got,
               it'll be worse after you see him. 
<b> 
</b>               He's just, he's a butcher. The man's a butcher."? And then there's 
               always that, "Make sure that you tell him that, you know, you know me." 
               Why? What's the difference? He's a doctor. What is it, "Oh, you know Bob! 
               Okay, I'll give you the real medicine. Everybody else, I'm giving Tic-Tacs."

               salad, and for dinner, I eat
<b> 
</b>               whatever I want.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               What do you think the worst part of 
               being blind is?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JULIANNA
</b>               Excuse me?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You know, if you were blind what do 
               you think the worst part of it would
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               be?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JULIANNA
</b>               I don't know.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I think it would be not being able to 
               tell if there was bugs in my food. 
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               How could you ever enjoy a meal like that? I'd constantly be 
               feeling around
<b> 
</b>               with my lips and my tongue.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JULIANNA
</b>               Well that's how my five-year old eats. 
               He's a very picky eater.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You hear about that kid that was kidnapped 
               the other day in
<b> 
</b>               Pennsylvania?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JULIANNA
</b>               No.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               He was at a carnival with his mother. 
               She goes to get a hot dog, next
<b> 
</b>               thing you know she turns around, boom, he's gone.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JULIANNA
</b>               Oh.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Imagine how sick a person has to be 
               to do something like that. And
<b> 
</b>               these people are all over the place. You never know who's crazy, 
               I could be one
<b> 
</b>               of these people.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JULIANNA
</b>               Have you seen any good movies?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Who takes care of your boy during the 
               day?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JULIANNA
</b>               We have a woman. Why?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               No no. I'm just saying.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JULIANNA
</b>               She had references.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I'm sure she did, I'm sure they're impeccable. 
               I'm talking about the
<b> 
</b>               ones that forge them. You know I think this is really helping.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JULIANNA
</b>               I don't live near here, ya know!

<b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               Jerry, Elaine and George are at Jerry's apartment.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               So she's giving me the massage and I'm 
               just making conversation.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I don't like to talk during a massage.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Neither do I, but I do it for them. 
               I figure they're bored.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Yeah, I do that too. I feel guilty about 
               getting the pleasure. I feel
<b> 
</b>               like I don't deserve it so I talk. It stops me from enjoying 
               it. There's
<b> 
</b>               nothing to eat in here.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Oh! I forgot to tell you--

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I'm in the middle of a story.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Okay, go ahead.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Why don't you ever go shopping?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Not like it's a really funny story or 
               anything.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               What happened?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Well so she mentioned that she had a 
               son, and the for some reason I
<b> 
</b>               launch into the story about the kid from Pennsylvania who was 
               abducted.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Oh, wasn't that terrible?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yes, it was.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Not even an apple.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               She doesn't want to hear that, that 
               was stupid.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I know it was stupid.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Really stupid.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Hey, I just said it was stupid.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               What about this leftover Chinese food?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Take it.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I can't believe you said that.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Hey, would you stop it already?

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               So, what did she say?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I don't know, she actually seemed to 
               get a little paranoid.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               This is terrible. What is this, ginger? 
               I hate ginger. I can't
<b> 
</b>               understand how anyone can eat ginger.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I have a good masseuse you could go 
               to.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Nah, she's really good and she's not 
               just a masseuse, she's a physical
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               therapist. There's a big difference. She uses the ultrasound, 
               it's a real
<b> 
</b>               medical procedure. In fact, if you get a doctor's note, it's 
               covered by
<b> 
</b>               insurance.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Physical therapy is covered by insurance?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yeah.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               You don't have to pay for the massage?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Not if you have a doctor's note.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               So where do you get this note?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Well I've never actually done it but 
               if I really wanted to I could
<b> 
</b>               probably get one from my friend Roy, the dentist.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Right, your friend Roy.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               What's the name of this physical therapist?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I'll tell you, but don't ask her anything 
               about her kid, she a little
<b> 
</b>               off.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               And you don't have to pay.

<b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               George and Elaine are at the physical therapist's office.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               We have three-o'clock appointments.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             RECEPTIONIST
</b>               George and Elaine, right? Could you 
               fill these out for me
<b> 
</b>               please? And Elaine, you'll be seeing Julianna, and George, you'll 
               be with
<b> 
</b>               Raymond.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Excuse me, did you say 'Raymond'?

<b>               
</b><b>                             RECEPTIONIST
</b>               Yes.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               But, uh, Raymond is a man.

<b>               
</b><b>                             RECEPTIONIST
</b>               That's right.

<b>               
</b>               George sits down slowly, letting this sink in.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I can't get a massage from a man.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Why not?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               What, are you crazy? I can't have a 
               man touching me. Switch with me.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               No, I don't want the man either.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               What's the difference, you're a woman. 
               They're supposed to be touching
<b> 
</b>               you.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               He'd just be touching your back.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               He'd just be touching your back too.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               No, it could get sexual.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I know. That's the point. If it's gonna 
               get sexual, it should get
<b> 
</b>               sexual with you.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I don't want it to feel good.

</b><b>                             ELAINE

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Exactly!

<b>               
</b>               A man walks up dressed in white.

<b>               
</b><b>                             RAYMOND
</b>               George?

</b><b>                             GEORGE

<b>               
</b><b>                             RAYMOND
</b>               I'm Raymond.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Hello.

<b>               
</b><b>                             RAYMOND
</b>               Are you ready?

<b>               
</b>               George gets up cautiously and walks with Raymond.

<b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               George is on the table getting a massage from Raymond. George 
               appears extremely
<b> 
</b>               uncomfortable.

<b>               
</b><b>                             RAYMOND
</b>               ...And then Julianna asked me if I wanted 
               to join her here in the
<b> 
</b>               office.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Really.

<b>               
</b><b>                             RAYMOND
</b>               I used to be a flight attendant.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Oh boy.

<b>               
</b><b>                             RAYMOND
</b>               Ya know, why don't you open those pants, 
               it's gonna be a lot easier
<b> 
</b>               that way.

<b>               
</b>               George loosens his pants, Raymond grabs them and yanks then down 
               his hips then
<b> 
</b>               starts massaging his lower back.

<b>               
</b><b>                             RAYMOND
</b>               So what do you do?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE

<b>               
</b><b>                             RAYMOND
</b>               I said, 'What do you do?'.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I don't know.

<b>               
</b><b>                             RAYMOND
</b>               You don't know what you do?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Nah.

<b>               
</b><b>                             RAYMOND
</b>               Oh, come on. Hey, you're very tense.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE

<b>               
</b><b>                             RAYMOND
</b>               Okay, just take off those pants now, 
               I'll work the hamstring.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Oh, the hamstring's fine.

<b>               
</b><b>                             RAYMOND
</b>               But you wrote that it was tender.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I wrote. Pfft, *I* wrote.

<b>               
</b><b>                             RAYMOND
</b>               I'll check it out.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Are you sure?

<b>               
</b><b>                             RAYMOND
</b>               Yeah, take 'em off.

<b>               
</b>               George gets up to remove his pants, he looks over and sees Raymond 
               rubbing his
<b> 
</b>               hands with oil. Nervous, George pulls his pants down and climbs 
               back on the
<b> 
</b>               table. As soon as Raymond touches his leg, George becomes rigid 
               with
<b> 
</b>               discomfort.

<b>               
</b><b>                             RAYMOND

</b><b>                             GEORGE

</b><b>                             GEORGE

</b><b>                             RAYMOND

</b><b>                             GEORGE

</b><b>                             RAYMOND

</b><b>                             GEORGE

</b><b>

<b> 
</b>               positively shell-shocked.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE

<b>               
</b>               George walks right out the door, ignoring Elaine.

<b>

<b>               
</b>               George enters acting nervous.

</b><b>                             GEORGE

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               That's a massage.

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               And then I took my pants off.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             GEORGE

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I think it moved.

</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             GEORGE

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I'm sure it didn't move.

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               It moved! It was imperceptible but I 
               felt it.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Maybe it just wanted to change positions? 
               You know, shift to the other
<b> 
</b>               side.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               No, no. It wasn't a shift, I've shifted, 
               this was a move.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               That's the sign! The test; if a man

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               That's not the test. Contact is the 
               test, if it moves as a result of
<b> 
</b>               contact.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE

</b><b>                             KRAMER

               I'm uh, you know, like I'm
<b> 
</b>               sitting in there, you know. And I start banging on the table, 
               you know, to uh,
<b> 
</b>               look up, you know, Like I'm sitting there you know and uh, *bang* 
               (slams the
<b> 
</b>               table) You know, *bang* He wouldn't move. So then I start doing 
               these yelping
<b> 
</b>               noises. Like, *yip* (high pitched yelping noises) *yip*. No reaction 
               because
<b> 
</b>               the guy is so focused, you see, he can just block out anything 
               that's going on
<b> 
</b>               around him. See, that's how he played baseball. He dunks like 
               he hits.

               bit, see how 
               you feel. No obligation, no pressure, just try it. Would you 
               like to see him in a sandal?'"
