</b>               My parents live in Florida now. They 
               moved there last year. They didn't want 
               to move to Floriday, but they're in 
               their sixties, and that's the law. You 
               know
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               how it works. They got the leisure police. They pull up in front 
               of the old people's house with a golf cart, jump out, "Let's 
               go Pop, white belt, white pants, white
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               shoes, get in the back. Drop the snow shovel right there, drop 
               it!" I am not much for the family gathering. You know, you sit 
               there, and the conversation's so boring.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               It's so dull. And you start to fantasize. You know, you think, 
               what if I just got up and jumped out that window? What would 
               it be like? Just crashed right through the
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               glass.. You know. Come back in, there's broken glass, everybody's 
               all upset. "No, I'm alright. I was just a little bored, there. 
               No, I'm fine. I came back. I wanted to
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               hear a little about that Hummel collection, Aunt Rose. Let's 
               pick it up right there."

<b>

               I don't know why you had to bring this 
               jacket. Who wears a jacket like this? 
               (He doesn't respond) What's
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               wrong with that nice gray one? You have beautiful clothes. They 
               sit in your closet. Morty, you can't wear - this!

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               We won. I made an incredible play in 
               the field! There was a tag-up at third 
               base and I threw the guy out from left 
               field on a fly! We'll be in the championship
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               game Wednesday because of me. It was the single greatest moment 
               of my life.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             HELEN
</b>               This is your greatest moment? A game?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Well, no. Sharon Besser, of course.

</b><b>                             MORTY
</b>               You know what my greatest moment was, 
               don't you? 1946. I went to work for 
               Harry Flemming and I came up with the 
               idea for the beltless trench coat.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             HELEN
</b>               Jerry, look at this sport jacket. Is 
               this a jacket to wear to an anniversary 
               party?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Well, the man's an individualist. He 
               worked for Harry Flemming. He knows 
               what he's doing.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             HELEN
</b>               But it's their 50th anniversary.

<b>               
</b><b>                             MORTY
</b>               You know, I spoke to Manya and Isaac 
               on the phone today. They invited you 
               again. I think you should go.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               First of all, I made plans with Elaine.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             HELEN
</b>               So bring her.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I don't even know them. What is she, 
               your second cousin? I mean, I've met 
               them three times in my life.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             MORTY
</b>               I don't know her either. (Gesturing 
               to Helen) She makes me fly all the way 
               from Floriday for this, and then she 
               criticizes my jacket.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             HELEN
</b>               At least come and say hello, have a 
               cup of coffee, then you'll leave.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             MORTY
</b>               How come he gets to leave?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               If I wind up sitting nest to Uncle Leo, 
               I am leaving. He's always grabbing my 
               arm when he talks to me. I guess it's 
               because so many people have left in 
               the
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               middle of his conversation.

</b><b>                             MORTY
</b>               And it's always about Jeffrey, right?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Hey, he talks about him like he split 
               the atom. The kid works for the Parks 
               Department.

               All of it. And I'm going to build these 
               different levels, with steps, and it'll 
               all be carpeted with a lot of pillows.

</b>               (Interrupting) Jerry, you wanna hear 
               something? Your cousin, Jeffrey, is 
               switching parks. They're transferring 
               him to Riverside - so he'll completely 
               revamp that
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               operation, you understand? He'll do in Riverside what he did 
               in Central Park. It's more money. So, that's your cousin.

</b>               Oh no, no, no. She forgot all about 
               that. She was much mor upset about the 
               potato salad.

               what's happening with your apartment?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ISAAC
</b>               Of course it's very hot there. I'l lhave 
               to get an air conditioner.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Oh, you can have mine. I'll ship it 
               out ot you.. but what about that big 
               apartment on West End Avenue?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ISAAC
</b>               Although they say it's a dry heat.

               apartment?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ISAAC
</b>               I don't even know if I should take my 
               winter clothing.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I have an idea. Leave the winter clothing 
               in the apartment, and I'll watch it 
               for you and I'll live there and I'll 
               make sure that nothing happens to it.

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I remember saying to myself, "Why is 
               Jerry so far off the base?"
<b> 
</b><b>

</b>               I'll have to live with this shame for

</b>               And they in the fifth inning, why did 
               you take off on the pop fly?

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I thought there were two outs.

</b>               I couldn't believe it when I saw you 
               running. I thought maybe they had changed 
               the rules or something.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Oh, well, of course. 1973.

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               You know.. the spirit world.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You think Manya showed up during the

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Yeah, but that doesn't make up for killing 
               her.

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Maybe Manya missed the funeral because 
               she was off visiting another galaxy 
               that day.

</b>               Don't you think she would've heard I

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Who figures and immigrant's gonna have 
               a pony?
<b> 
</b><b>

<b>

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               What is the pony? What is the point 
               of the pony? Why do we have these animals, 
               these ponies? What do we do with them? 
               Besides the pony ride. Why
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               ponies? What are we doing with them? I mean, police don't use 
               them for, you know, crowd control. "Hey, uh, you wanna get back 
               behind the barricades. Hey!
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Hey, little boy. Yeah, I'm talking to you. Behind the barricades!" 
               So somebody, I assume, genetically engineered these ponies. Do 
               you think they could make them
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               any size? I mean, could they make them like the size of a quarter, 
               if they wanted? That would be fun for Monopoly, though, wouldn't 
               it? Just have a little pony and
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               you put him on the, "Baltic, that's two down, go ahead. Hold 
               it. Right ther, Baltic. yeah, that's it. Fine. Right there, hold 
               it right there."
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                                  THE END
