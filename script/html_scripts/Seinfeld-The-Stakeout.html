</b>               So, I'm on line at the supermarket. 
               Two women in front of me. One of
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               them, her total was eight dollars, the other three dollars. They 
               both
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               of course choose to pay by the use of the (pause and gesture 
               to audience
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               for response)

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Cheque. Now, the fact is, if it's a 
               woman in front of you that's
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               writing the cheque, you will not be waiting long. I have noticed 
               that
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               women are very *fast* with cheques, y'know, 'cuz they write out 
               so many
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               cheques. The keys, they can never find in their purse, they don't 
               know
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               where that is, but the cheque book they got that. They never 
               fumble for
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               book from an imaginary holster) ``Who do I make it out to?... 
               There's my
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               ID...''. There's something about a cheque that, to a man, is 
               not masculine.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               I don't know exactly what it is... I think to a man, a cheque 
               is like a note
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               from your mother that says ``I don't have any money, but if you'll
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               contact these people, I'm sure they'll stick up for me... If 
               you
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               just trust me this one time I don't have any money but I have
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               these... I wrote on these; is this of any value at all?''

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yeah, but if you called up and described

               you want to wait until we get
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               in the car?

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Oh no, let's do it now.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Alright, the whole elevator business, 
               let me just explain--
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Okay...

<b>               
</b><b>                             ARTIE
</b>               Jerry, were you goin' with us?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               No, I'm gonna take my car.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ARTIE
</b>               That's why I brought the wagon. Why 
               the Hell did I bring the wagon?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Anyway, you know why I didn't ask you, 
               I mean I felt so
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               uncomfortable, and you were *so* annoyed in the cab.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Well, Jerry, I never saw you flirt with 
               anyone before. It was
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               quite the spectacle.

<b>               
</b><b>                             CAROL
</b>               Jerry, we'll see you there. Bye, Elaine.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Oh, bye. Good to see you.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ARTIE
</b>               Oh, we didn't meet.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Oh, I'm sorry. Elaine, this is my cousin 
               Artie Levine.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ARTIE
</b>               Le*vine*.

<b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yeah, "Le*vine*". And I'm Jerry Cougar 
               Mellencamp... Anyway, I
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               admit it was a fairly ridiculous thing to do, but I mean, I mean,
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               obviously we have a little problem here.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Yeah, obviously.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I mean, if we're gonna be friends, we 
               gotta be able to talk about
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               other people...

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Couldn't agree more.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Good.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Good.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Good.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Great!

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Great? Where do you get "great"?

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               It's great to... talk about... other 
               people...
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               ...Guys.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Yeah.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Uh-huh... Yeah... So, anybody specific?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               No. A general guy.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Oh *really*... Elaine Marie Benes...
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               What? No, it's not a big deal.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               No, that's great! That's terrific!
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               No, we just met...

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Doesn't matter. What's the young man's 
               name? I would like to
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               meet him.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I don't think so...

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Well, what does he do? Is he an artisan, 
               a craftsman, a labourer
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               of some sort?

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Wall street.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Ahh, high finance: bulls... bears... 
               people from Conneticut.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               And he happens to be pretty good lookin'
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               (pause) Alright, sir.

<b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               And... he's *hilarious*.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Now that's not fair! So where did you 
               meet this guy?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I "staked" out his health club.

<b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               When you're on a stakeout, do you find 
               it's better to stand up
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               against the wall, or kinda crouch down behind a big plant?...
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Y'know I think that even if you've had 
               a relationship with someone,
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               or let's say, *especially* if you've had a relationship with 
               someone
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               and you try to become friends afterwards, it's very difficult.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               Isn't this? It's hard. Because, you know each other so well, 
               you
<b>               
</b>               know all of each others tricks. It's like two magicians, trying 
               to entertain each other.

<b>               
</b>               The one goes, "Look, a rabbit."

<b>               
</b>               The other goes, "So? ... I believe this is your card."

<b>               
</b>               "Look, why don't we just saw each other in half and call it a 
               night? Okay?"

<b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             THE END
</b>
