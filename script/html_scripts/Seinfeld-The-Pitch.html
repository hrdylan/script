<b> 
</b>               discussing you at some of our meetings and we'd be very interested

<b> 
</b>               we'd just love to talk about it.

</b><b>                             STU

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You know, a TV show.

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Your own show?

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yeah, I guess so.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               They want you to do a TV show?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Well, they want me to come up with an 
               idea. I mean, I don't have
<b> 
</b>               any ideas.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Come on, how hard is that? Look at all 
               the junk that's on TV.
<b> 
</b>               You want an idea? Here's an idea. You coach gymnastics team in 
               high
<b> 
</b>               school. And you're married. And your son's not interested in 
               gymnastics
<b> 
</b>               and you're pushing him into gymnastics.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Why should I care if my son's into gymnastics?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Because you're a gymnastics teacher. 
               It's only natural.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               But gymnastics is not for everybody.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I know, but he's your son.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               So what?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               All right, forget that idea, it's not 
               for you....Okay, okay, I
<b> 
</b>               got it. You run an antique store.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yeah and...?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               And people come in the store and you 
               get involved in their
<b> 
</b>               lives.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               What person who runs an antique store 
               gets involved in people's
<b> 
</b>               lives?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Why not?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               So someone comes in to buy an old lamp 
               and all of a sudden I'm
<b> 
</b>               getting them out of a jam? I could see if I was a pharmacist 
               because a
<b> 
</b>               pharmacist knows what's wrong with everybody that comes in.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I know, but antiques are very popular 
               right now.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               No they're not, they used to be.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Oh yeah, like you know.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Oh like you do.

</b><b>                             KRAMER

</b>               got all these freaks on the show. A woman with a moustache? I 
               mean, who
<b> 
</b>               wouldn't tune in to see a women with a moustache? You've for

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You know why? Because people like to 
               say "salsa." "Excuse me, do
<b> 
</b>               you have salsa?" "We need more salsa." "Where is the salsa? No

               Spanish person to order
<b> 
</b>               seltzer and not get salsa. (Angry) "I wanted seltzer, not salsa."

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Who says you gotta have a story? Remember 
               when we were waiting for,
<b> 
</b>               for that table in that Chinese restaurant that time? That could 
               be a TV

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Yeah. There's something wrong with that? 
               I'm a character. People are always saying 
               to me, "You know you're a quite a character."

</b><b>                             GEORGE

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I still don't know what the idea is.

</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             GEORGE

</b><b>                             JERRY

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               They say, "What's your show about?"

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               So, the show would be about my real

               be based on you.

               And it's funny because my new radar

               What were you thinking? What was going 
               on in your mind? Artistic integrity? 
               Where, where did you come up with that? 
               You're not artistic and you have no 
               integrity. You know you really need 
               some help. A regular psychiatrist couldn't 
               even help you. You need to go to like 
               Vienna or something. You know what I 
               mean? You need to get involved at the 
               University level. Like where Freud studied 
               and have all those people looking at 
               you and checking up on you. That's the 
               kind of help you need. Not the once 
               a week for eighty bucks. No. You need 
               a team. A team of psychiatrists working 
               round the clock thinking about you, 
               having conferences, observing you, like 
               the way they did with the Elephant Man. 
               That's what I'm talking about because 
               that's the only way you're going to 
               get better.

</b>               Vommiting is not a deal breaker. If 
               Hitler had vommited on Chamberlin, Chamberlind 
               still would have given him Chekoslovakia.

</b>               Chamberlind, you could hold his head 
               in nthe toilet, he'd still give you 
               half of Europe.

               I was walking home and I had to pick 
               up my helmet from the shop, you know. 
               I gota new strap. And I had it on you 
               know, and I was checking the strap out 
               to make sure it fit. Then suddenly I 
               feel this kick hit me on the side of 
               the head. It knocks me down, I look 
               up and it's Crazy Joe Devola. And he 
               say's, "That's what I thin k of your

</b>               What does he want from me? I didn't

               psychiatrist. He probably can't get 
               his medication. Now I got some nut after
