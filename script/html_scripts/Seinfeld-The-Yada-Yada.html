</b>               So you won't believe what happened with 
               Whatley today. It got back to hime that 
               I made this little dentist joke and 
               he got all offended. Those people can 
               be so touchy.

</b>               You think that dentists are so different 
               from me and you? They came to this country 
               just like everybody else, in search 
               of a dream.

               starts with a few jokes and some slurs. 
               "Hey, denty!" Next thing you know you're 
               saying they should have their own schools.
