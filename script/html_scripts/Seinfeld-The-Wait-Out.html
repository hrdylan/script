               over at the table. A man and a woman

               (Leaning in for confidentiality) You 
               know, I heard a rumor their marriage 
               was a little rocky.

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Well, I have to admit, I've always thought 
               David was kind of sponge-worthy. (Winks, 
               making a clicking sound with her tongue)

               for three years.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Yeah, me too. Well, I've been waiting 
               out two or three marriages, but this 
               is the one I really had my eye on.

</b><b>                             DAVID

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (Laughs slightly) A physician married

               tell you, Beth, you coulda done a lot 
               better than him.

               You know, when I first met you, Kramer, 
               you used to wear jeans all the time.

               upset) You think that I'm not able to 
               wear jeans anymore? Is that what you're 
               sayin'? Because if that's what you're

               to the right, then yells out of her

</b>               Their grieving time is a luxury I can't 
               afford. I'm calling Beth tonight, and 
               if you want a clean shot at David, I 
               suggest you do likewise.

</b>               But we gotta make it seem like we're 
               not calling for dates.

</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b>               Good question. (More to himself than 
               to Elaine) Why are we calling?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               (Both start chanting "why are we calling..", thinking deeply)

               I've got it! I've got it! We're calling 
               just to say, "I'm there for you."

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Then, after a period of being "there 
               for you", we slowly remove the two words 
               "for you", and we're just (Makes a "ta-da!" 
               gesture) "there".

               great difficulty. Jerry starts to laugh
