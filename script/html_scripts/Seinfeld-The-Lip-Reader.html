</b>               Professional tennis. To me I don't understand 
               all the shushing. Why are they always 
               shushing. Shh, shh. Don't the players 
               know that we're there? Should we duck 
               down behind the seats so they don't 
               see us watching them? Tennis is basically 
               just ping-pong and the players are standing 
               on the table. That's all it is. And 
               that goofy scoring, you win one point 
               and all the sudden you're up by 15. 
               Two points, 30-love. 30-love. Sounds 
               like an English call girl. "That'll 
               be 30, love... And could you be a little 
               quieter next time, please, shh."

</b>               A party is a bad date situation. It 
               doesn't matter who you're with. You 
               could be with J. Edgar Hoover. You don't 
               want to sit and talk with Hoover all 
               night. You want to circulate. (Makes 
               hand motions) Ho, ho, ho.

</b>               Well I would think, with the law enforcement 
               and the cross dressing. Seems like an 
               interesting guy.

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Yeah I guess. What can I do? I gotta 
               take her with me. Todd introduced us, 
               I'm obligated.

               I take one, the driver will *not* stop 
               talking to me. No matter how disinterested 
               I seem he just keeps yakking away. Blah, 
               blah, blah, blah. Why does everything 
               always have to have a social componant? 
               Now a stage coach, that would have been 
               a good situation for me. Cause I'm in 
               the coach, and the driver is way up 
               there on the stage.

</b>               Yeah yeah, I know your type. You're 
               too good to make conversation with someone 
               like me. Oh god forbid you could discuss 
               the Jumbles. But to go so far as to 
               pretend you're almost deaf, I mean that 
               is truly disgusting. And Mr. Tom Hanks, 
               may I say he too would be disgusted 
               by your behavior.

</b>               Yeah when I was 8, I had a deaf cousin 
               who lived with us for about a year. 
               (signing as he speaks) So I haven't 
               been able to do it in a while.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I met this deaf lineswoman at the tennis 
               match.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               You are kidding. That is amazing. (She 
               pushes Jerry, Jerry falls back into 
               Kramer.) I just took a car service from 
               work and to get the driver to not talk 
               to me, I pretended I was going deaf.
<b> 
</b><b>

</b><b>                             JERRY

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Oh didn't work. He caught me hearing. 
               I know it's terrible, but I'm not a 
               terrible person.
<b>

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               No. When I shoo squirrels away, I always 
               say "get out of here". I never ever 
               throw things at them and try to injure 
               them like other people.
<b> 
</b><b>

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Yeah, and when I see freaks in the street 
               I never, ever stare at them. Yet, I'm 
               careful not to look away, you know, 
               because I want to make the freaks feel 
               comfortable.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               That's nice for the freaks.

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Yeah, and I don't poof up my hair when 
               I got to a movie so people behind me 
               can see. I've got to make it up to this 
               guy or I won't be able to live with 
               myself. What can I do?

               something, how about that friend of 
               yours that works at the ticket area.

               tickets to something. Like a rock concert. 
               Whatever you like.

</b><b>

</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               You got it. Hey Jerry, do me a favor. 
               The next time you see that lineswoman 
               ask her how those ball boys get those 
               jobs. I would love to be able to do 
               that.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Kramer, I think perhaps you've overlooked 
               one of the key aspects of this activity. 
               It's ball *boys*, not ball men. There 
               are no ball men.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Yeah I think he's right. I've never 
               seen a ball man.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Well there ought to be ball men.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               All right I'll talk to her. If you want 
               to be a ball man go ahead, break the 
               ball barrier.

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               Hey you know a friend of mine from work

               snack bar eating a hot fudge sundae. 
               He had it all over his face. He was 
               wearing that chocolate on his face like 
               a beard and they got in there real nice 
               and tight. And he's... (Imitates scooping 
               up ice cream.)

</b>               I know what you were trying to do. Nobody

               she saw him eating the ice cream on

</b><b>                             KRAMER

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Well if a couple breaks up and have 
               plans to go to a neutral place, who 
               withdraws? What's the ettiquite?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I think she should withdraw. She's the 
               breaker, he's the breakee. He needs 
               to get on with his life.

               anyway. I don't want to fight that traffic

</b>               So, I've got ice cream all over my face. 
               There were no napkins there. Whoever 
               it was that's responsible for stocking 
               that concession stand cost me a relationship.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Let's get the check. (Waves in the air) 
               Is this considered signing? Do you do 
               this when you want the check? Really. 
               I know a sign, that's my first sign.

</b><b>                             GEORGE

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (Holding his drink up to his mouth) 
               Oh my gosh, I just had a great idea. 
               She could come to the party tomorrow 
               and read Gwen's lips for me.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               (Puts nuts into his mouth, and in the 
               process covers his mouth) We bring her 
               to the party, and she can tell me what 
               Gwen is saying about me.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               (Holds his drink up to his mouth) She's 
               not a novelty act, George. Where you 
               hire her out for weddings and bar mitzvas.
<b> 
</b><b>

</b>               (Puts his hands on his face, rubbing 
               his eyes) Look. It's a skill, just like 
               juggling. She probably enjoys showing 
               it off.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               (Puts his napkin over his mouth) I don't 
               know George. I'm not sure about this.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>

</b>               (Puts his arms in the air, stretching, 
               and covers his mouth with an arm) Could 
               you ask her, just ask her. If she says 
               no, case closed.
<b> 
</b><b>

               So we'll swing by and pick you up. How 
               about six? (Laura looks offended). Six 
               is good. (Laura looks offended and angry). 
               You got a problem with six? (Laura opens 
               the door and gets out). What? What?
