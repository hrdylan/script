</b>               I've been watching women in the department 
               stores. They're trying on clothes, and 
               I've noticed that they do it differently 
               from men. Women don't try on the clothes, 
               they get behind the clothes, you see? 
               They take a dress off the rack, and 
               they hold it up against themself. They 
               can tell something from this. They stick 
               one leg way out 'cause they nedd to 
               know, if some day I'm one-legged, and 
               at a fourty-five degree angle, what 
               am I gonna wear? You never see a man 
               do that. You never see a guy take a 
               suit off the rack, put his head in the 
               neck, and go, "What do you think about 
               this suit? I think I'll get it. Yeah, 
               it looks fine. Put some shoes by the 
               bottom of the pants, I wanna make sure. 
               Yeah, perfect. And what if I'm walking? 
               Move the shoes, move the shoes, move 
               the shoes, move the shoes.

               a way to avoid the things that cause 
               the little problems. Maybe some rules

</b>               Beautiful. Let's make it a rule.

</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               All right, sir.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Now here's another little rule. When 
               we see each other now, we retire to 
               our separate quarters. But sometimes, 
               when people get involved with that, 
               they feel pressure to sleep over. When 
               that is not really sleep. Sleep is separate 
               from that. And I don't see why sleep 
               got all tied up and connected with that.

               eat. Eventually, firemen would have 
               to break through the door, they'd find 
               me sitting there in my pajamas with 
               drool coming down my face. All right,

               is they're not happy if you don't spend 
               the night. I could be a hot, sweaty 
               room with no air conditioning and all 
               they have is a little army cot this 
               wide (Displays with French fry) You're 
               not going anywhere.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Could be it.

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               She seems like an it.

<b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               She's at it as you get. Imagine bumping 
               into her on the street in five years 
               with a husband. And she tells me he's 
               a sculptor, they live in Vermont...

</b>               We'd have to kill him.

</b>               We'd get caught, I'd get the chair.

</b>               I'd go to prison as your accomplice. 
               I'd have to wear that really heavy denim. 
               Go to the cafeteria line with the guy 
               who slops those mashed potatoes onto 
               your plate. Go to the bathroom in front 
               of hundreds of people.
