</b>               Most men like working on things, tools, 
               objects, fixing things. This is what 
               men enjoy doing. Have you ever noticed 
               a guy's out in his driveway working 
               on
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               something with tools, how all the other men in the neighborhood 
               are magnetically drawn to this activity. They just come wandering 
               out of the house like zombies.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Men, it's true, men hear a drill, it's like a dog whistle. Just.. 
               you know, they go running up to that living room curtain, "Honey, 
               I think Jim's working on something over
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               there." So they run over to the guy. Now they don't actually 
               help the guy. No, they just want to hang around the area where 
               work is being done. That's what men
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               want to do. We want to watch the guy, we want to talk to him, 
               we want to ask him dumb questions. You know, "What are you using, 
               the Philips head?" You know,
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               we feel involved. That's why when they have construction sites, 
               they have to have those wood panel fences around it, that's just 
               to keep the men out. They cut those
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               little holes for us so we can see what the hell is going on. 
               But if they don't cut those holes - we are climbing those fences. 
               Right over there. "What are you using the
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               steel girders down there? Yeah, that'll hold."

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I had to say something. I had to say 
               something. Everything was going so well; 
               I had to say something.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I don't think you did anything wrong.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I told her I liked her. Why? Why did 
               I tell her I like her? I have this sick 
               compulsion to tell women how I feel. 
               I like you I don't tell you.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               We can only thank God for that.

<b>               
</b>               (Elevator opens, they get on)

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I'm outta the picture. I am outta the 
               picture. (laughs) It's only a matter 
               of time now.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You're imagining this. Really.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Oh no. No, no, no, no.

<b>               
</b>               (elevator doors close)

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I'll tell you when it happened. When 
               that floss came flying out of my pocket.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               What floss? When?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               We were in the lobby during the intermission 
               of the play. I was buying her one of 
               those containers of orange drink, for 
               five dollars. I reached into my
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               pocket to pay for it, I looked down; there's this piece of green 
               floss hanging from my fingers.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Ah, mint.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Of course. So, I'm looking at it, I 
               look up, I see she's looking at it. 
               Our eyes lock. It was a horrible moment. 
               I just..
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               (eleveator doors open, they get off)

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               So let me get this straight: she saw 
               the floss, you panicked and you told 
               her you liked her.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               If I didn't put that floss in my pocket, 
               I'd be crawling around her bedroom right 
               now looking for my glasses.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               And you're sure the floss was the catalyst?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Yes, I am.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               (looks at a carrying pouch George is 
               wearing) You don't think it might've 
               had anything to do with that?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               What? You don't like this?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               It looks like your belt is digesting 
               a small animal.

               phone)

               it's all big business.. Oh hey, Jerry 
               just walked in. Hi, George. (resumes 
               talking on the phone) Yeah, yeah yeah,
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               yeah, take my number - 555-8643. Okay, here he is. (hands phone 
               to Jerry.)

</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Take it.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               (into phone) Hello? Oh, hi Joel. (Jerry 
               hits Kramer with a magazine.) .. No. 
               I was out of town. I just got back.. 
               Kramer doesn't know anything.. He's 
               just
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               my next-door neighbor. Uh.. nothing much.. Tuesday? Uh, Tuesday, 
               no. I'm meeting somebody.. Uh, Wednesday? Wednesday's okay.. 
               Alright. Uh, I'm a little busy
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               right now. Can we talk Wednesday morning? .. Okay.. yeah.. right.. 
               thanks.. bye. (hangs up, then addresses Kramer) Why did you put 
               me on the phone with him? I
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               hate just being handed a phone.

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Well, it's your phone. He wanted to 
               talk to you
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Maybe I didn't want to talk to him.
<b> 
</b><b>

</b><b>                             KRAMER

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               He bothers me. I don't even answer the 
               phone anymore because of him. He's turned 
               me into a screener. Now I gotta go see 
               him on Wednesday.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               What do you mean Wednesday? I though 
               we had tickets to the Knick game Wednesday. 
               We got seats behind the bench! What 
               happened? We're not
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               going?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               We're going. That's next Wednesday.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               His name is Joel Horneck. He lived like 
               three houses down from me when I grew 
               up. He had a Ping Pong table. We were 
               friends. Should I suffer the rest of
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               my life because I like to play Ping Pong? I was ten. I would've 
               been friends with Stalin if he had a Ping Pong table.. he's so 
               self-involved.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               (phone rings, Kramer pulls his phone out of his pocket)

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               That's for me. (into phone) Kramerica 
               Industries.. Oh, hi, Mark.. No, no, 
               no. Forget that. I got a better idea.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Can you conduct your business elsewhere?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               (ignoring Jerry) No, no, no. I'm talking 
               about a whole chain of 'em. Yeah. (Kramer 
               leaves Jerry's apartment while still 
               on the phone.)

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I don't know why you even bother with 
               this ping pong guy, I'll tell you that.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               I don't bother with him. He's been calling 
               me for seven years. I've never called 
               him once! He's got the attention span 
               of a five-year-old. Sometimes I sit
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               there and I make up things just to see if he's paying attention.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               I don't understand why you spend time 
               with this guy.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               What can I do? Break up with him? Tell 
               him "I Don't think we're right for each 
               other.." He's a guy. At least with a 
               woman, there's a precendent. You know,
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               the relationship goes sour, you end it.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               No, no, no,no you have to approach this 
               as if he was a woman.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Just break up with him?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Absolutely. You just tell him the truth.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               As a guy I don't know how I can break 
               up with another guy. You know what I 
               mean? I don't know how to say, "Bill, 
               I feel I need to see other men." Do
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               you know what I mean? There's nothing I can do. I have to wait 
               for someone to die. I think that's the only way out of this relationship. 
               It could be a long time. See,
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               the great thing about guys is that we can become friends based 
               on almost nothing. Just two guys will just become friends just 
               because they're two guys. That's almost
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               all we need to have in common. 'Cause sports - sports and women 
               - is really all we talk about. If there was no sports and no 
               women the only thing guys would ever
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               say is "So, what's in the refrigerator?"

               mother in for a session. This guy is 
               a brilliant man. Lenny Bruce used to 
               go to him.. and I think, uh, Geraldo.

</b>               I don't need anymore.

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               No, no, no, no, no, these are good. 
               Listen, listen: "You ran out of underwear, 
               you can't leave the house."

               you, you're Dan."

               this. This is absolutely infantile.

</b>               Oh no. That's impossible. I'd rather 
               lie to him for the rest of my life that 
               go through that again. He was crying, 
               tears accompanied by mucus.

</b>               You made a man cry? I've never made 
               a man cry. I even kicked a guy in the 
               groin once and he didn't cry.. I got 
               the cab.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Right. I forgot about choir.

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               We're doing that evening of Eastern

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Right. You know, the wall being down

               see if we qualify as those organ donors.

</b>               You know, I should really try something 
               like that.

</b><b>                             JERRY

</b>               Well, let's just take a look here. (looks 
               at his schedule) Forty-one home games. 
               Saturday night we've got the mavericks. 
               If you don't like the Mavericks, next
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               Tuesday - Lakers. I mean, you gotta like Magic, right? Let's 
               see, on the road, on the road, on the road, on the road, back 
               on the fourteenth. They play the Bulls.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               You can't miss Air Jordan..

<b>               
</b>               (Scene ends.)

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You know, I really.. I've come to the 
               conclusion that there are certain friends 
               in you life that they're just always 
               your friends and you have to accept 
               it. You
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               see them, you don't really want to see them. You don't call them. 
               They call you. You don't call back. They call again. The only 
               way to get through talking with people
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               that you don't really have anything in common with is to pretend 
               you're hosting your own little talk show. This is what I do. 
               You pretend there's a little desk around
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               you. The only problem with this is there's no way you can say, 
               "Hey, it's been great having you on the show. Were out of time."
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                                 THE END
