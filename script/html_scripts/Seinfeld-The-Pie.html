               pie in the city. (Jerry starts eating) 
               Delicious. I'm not waiting for you. 
               Take some.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You're not gonna have any?

</b><b>                             AUDREY

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Do you not like apple pie?

<b>               
</b><b>                             AUDREY
</b>               No, it's not that.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Well, at least taste it.

</b><b>                             AUDREY
</b>               No (a resolute "no")

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               You won't even taste it?

</b><b>                             AUDREY

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Come on, try it! (Audrey shakes her

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Did she say why?

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               No. She wouldn't say anything. She just 
               kept shaking her head like this (Imitating 
               Audrey)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Maybe she's diabetic.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               No. She carries Entemanns doughnuts 
               in her purse.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Maybe you said something that offended 
               her.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               The only thing I can think of is I told 
               her we should have those moving walkways 
               all over the city.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE

</b><b>                             JERRY

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               That's a great idea!!!

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Tell me about it!

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               We could be zipping all over the place.

</b><b>

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               They could at least try it.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               They never try anything.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               What's the harm?

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               No harm!

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               (still talking to George) I'm sorry. 
               There's no reason for her not to taste 
               that pie.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Boy, I never broke up with anyone for 
               not tasting pie???
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               (piffling) I once broke up with someone 
               for not offering me pie.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY

</b>               He could be eating a Hero, he wouldn't 
               offer me anything. It's a sickness.

</b>               Well, I can't walk anywhere now. I just 
               gonna be wishing there were walkways. 
               (seeing Elaine removing her shoe) What 
               are you doing?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               I got a pebble.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Boy, I never heard of that happening

<b>

</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               (to the gang) There's a clothing store 
               downtown. They got a mannequin in there 
               that looks exactly like Elaine.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               It's uncanny! It's like they chopped 
               off your arms and legs, dipped you in 
               plastic, and screwed you back all together, 
               and stuck you on a pedestal. It's really 
               quite exquisite.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE

               what the hell's Kramer doing)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               It's this itch. I was watching TV without 
               my shirt on, and one my couch cushion 
               didn't have any fabric on it.
<b>

               MacKenzie, and I think I'm really close. 
               They're all taking me out to lunch on

</b><b>                             OLIVE
</b>               Someone else?

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Yeah, yeah, yeah...

<b>               
</b><b>                             OLIVE
</b>               Who is she?

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Her. (he points to the Elaine mannequin 
               in Jerry's car)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             OLIVE

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Yeah, there she is. That's my gal.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             OLIVE
</b>               You're a liar. I've seen her in here 
               before. She's not your girlfriend.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Now Olive, look, I'm sorry.

<b>               
</b><b>                             OLIVE
</b>               Why is she wearing her underwear?

<b>               
</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Well, it's a style. (turns back to Jerry) 
               Jerry give me the keys. (Jerry throws 
               his keys to Kramer) Well, I guess we're 
               gonna go for a drive now. She really 
               loves that.

</b>               (Kramer gets into Jerry's car and starts making out with the 
               mannequin while Olive is looking through the window. But it doesn't 
               work quite as good as Kramer was hoping cause the mannequin's 
               hand fall out from the arm!)
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               (Commercials cut the scene but we assume Kramer left with Jerry's 
               car and the mannequin. Jerry and George are still at the table, 
               eating dessert)

               pie?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               No. That's one for the ages. But I think 
               they're gonna put Poppie away for a 
               long long time.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               (Elaine enters and sit with Jerry and George. Olive is looking 
               at her, confused.)

               I just got a letter from a friend of 
               mine in Chicago who's shopping, and 
               she said she saw a mannequin that looked 
               just like me. What if there're more. 
               Where are they coming from?

</b>               Ricky, we've been getting a tremendous 
               response to your TR-6 mannequin.

</b>               TR-6? I prefer to think of her as... 
               Elaine.
