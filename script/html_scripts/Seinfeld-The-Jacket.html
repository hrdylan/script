</b>               I hate clothes, okay? I hate buying 
               them. I hate picking them out of my 
               closet. I can't stand every day trying 
               to come up with little outfits for myself. 
               I think
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               eventually fashion won't even exist. It won't. I think eventually 
               we'll all be wearing the same thing. 'Cause anytime I see a movie 
               or a TV show where there's people
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               from the future of another planet, they're all wearing the same 
               thing. Somehow they decided "This is going to be our outfit. 
               One-piece silver jumpsuit, V-stripe, and
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               boots. That's it." We should come up for an outfit for earth. 
               An earth outfit. We should vote on it. Candidates propose different 
               outfits, no speeches. They walk out,
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               twirl, walk off. We just sit in the audience and go, "That was 
               nice. I could wear that."

</b>               The back? They never find anything in 
               the back. If they had anything good 
               in the back, they'd put it out in the 
               front.

               for the back? Call it, "Just Back." 
               All back. No front. You walk in the 
               front, you're immediately in the back.

               changed my life. When I leave the house 
               in this, it's with a whole different 
               confidence. Like tonight, I might've 
               been

</b><b>               
</b>               a little nervous. But, inside this jacket, I am composed, grounded, 
               secure that I can meet an social challenge.
