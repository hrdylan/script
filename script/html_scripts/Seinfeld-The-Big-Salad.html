<b>               
</b>               It's fascinating. When you go into a stationery store that they're               
               manufacturing millions of pens; constantly we're all buying them. 
               I must have bought six thousand Bics in my life. I've used up maybe 
               two of them. Where are the rest of them? When you move the refrigerator 
               there's a couple back there but it doesn't account for it. Where are all 
               the pens?
<b> 
</b>               That's why it's so embarrassing if you don't have one. You got 
               a pen? Can I borrow a pen? We always have to whisper because it's so 
               humiliating. 

               I don't have a pen. They're making millions of them every week! I know; 
               where are they?

               a lot. But today was it! We're on the 
               fifteenth hole, ya, he's beating me 
               by a couple of strokes. Then, he's about 
               to hit his second shot, when, he picks 
               up the ball and CLEANS it.

</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Umph, sorry! But the rules clearly state 
               that you cannot clean the ball unless 
               it's on the green. The rules are very 
               clear about that.

               Hebert h-e-b-e-r-t. "Hebert" it's a 
               fun name to pronounce. Try and say it

               to Police headquarters for questioning 
               the murder of Bobby Pinkus the owner 
               of Royal Dry Cleaners at 2759 Amsterdam 
               Avenue. According to Pinkus' wife, Gendeson 
               had been involved in a dispute with 
               the cleaner about a stain on a pair 
               of gray Sans-A-Belt slacks. We also 
               have a report that earlier in the day

               Course saw an irate Gendeson leaving 
               the clubhouse in a huff. Whether there 
               is a possible connection between the

               wait.

</b><b>                             ELAINE
</b>               It must be a mistake.

</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               No. It isn't and the most distressing 
               part of it is, not that she went out 
               with him but that HE stopped seeing 
               her. Do you understand? He, Newman; 
               Newman stopped seeing her. Newman never 
               stopped seeing anybody. Newman will 
               see whoever is willing to see him. Not 
               so much why she did see him as disturbing 
               as that is. But why, did HE, Newman, 
               stop seeing her?

               the eye.

               He's pure evil.

</b><b>                             ELAINE

</b><b>                             KRAMER
</b>               Oh yeah, he said he brought a pair of

               stained with some kind of dry cleaning 
               fluid. And Pinkus denied responsibility. 
               You see he was very upset with Pinkus.

</b>               You know, I think I could have played 
               with dolls if their were dolls in the 
               house. It seems like fun to me. It doesn't 
               seem like a gender thing. I think I 
               would like to play with dolls. What's 
               so terrible?

               that was kind of intriguing.

</b>               Well, when I came over to the table 
               she mentioned something about how she 
               better hurry up and leave or you'd make 
               her buy lunch to make up for the one 
               you bought yesterday.

               be under the impression that you bought 
               the big salad, when I was the one who 
               handed it to her?

</b><b>                             GEORGE

</b><b>                             JULIE

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               . . .uh, . . . wait a second. Are you 
               suggesting that I went out of my way 
               to tell Elaine that even though you 
               handed her the big salad, that it came 
               from me?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JULIE
</b>               That's what I'm suggesting.

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b><b>               . . . WELL IT WAS A BIG SALAD. AND WHAT

</b><b>               BIG SALAD CLAIM RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT

</b>               Jail doesn't really seem like that great 
               of revenge. Wouldn't years of subtle 
               psychological mind games be a lot more 
               satisfying? Constantly calling him, 
               hanging up when he answers the phone. 
               Sending pizzas and taxis to their house 
               all night long. After a while he would 
               go, "I wish that guy would kill me already, 
               I can't take it anymore." And how come 
               when the police catch some really bad 
               criminal or something they put him in 
               the handcuffs, they hit him with the 
               baton, they put the choke hold on him, 
               then they're always careful they don't 
               want him to hurt his head when they're 
               putting him in the back of the patrol 
               car. "Watch your head, watch your head. 
               Don't hit that metal edge there. . .
