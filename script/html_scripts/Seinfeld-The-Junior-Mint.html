</b>               You can't just *have* an adultery-- 
               you *commit* adultery. And you
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               can't even *commit* adultery unless you already *have* a commitment.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               So you have to make the commitment before you can even think 
               about
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               committing it. There's no commit without the commit. Then, once
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               you commit, then you can commit the adultery and then you get 
               caught,
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               get divorced, lose your mind and they have you committed. But 
               y'know
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               some people actually *cheat* on the people that they're cheating
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               with. Which is like, y'know, being in a hold up and then turning
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               to the robber next to you and goin' "Alright, gimme everything 
               you
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               have, too".

</b>               I was a little nervous, I got distracted. 
               It has something to do

</b>               Oh my God, I forgot to tell you. I got 
               a letter today from the
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               State Controller's Office. Y'know when I was going to public 
               school
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               back in Brooklyn, every week I used to put fifty cents in the
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               Lincoln Savings Bank.

<b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Yeah, I did that too.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               You remember the, the little bank book, 
               there?
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>                             JERRY
</b>               Sure.

<b>               
</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Alright, so I haven't put anything in 
               it since sixth grade, I
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               completely forgot about it. The State Controller's Office tracks
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               me down. The interest has accumulated to 1 900 dollars. 1 900
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               dollars! They're sending me a cheque!

</b><b>                             GEORGE
</b>               Yeah, interest. It's an amazing thing. 
               You make money without
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               doing anything...

</b>               Ages zero through ten, candy is your 
               life. There's nothing else.
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Family, friends, school-- they're only obstacles in the way of
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               getting more candy. And you have your favourite candies that 
               you
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               love. "I love those... I hate those...". "I hate those... I
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               love those...". And only a seven year old kid can taste the
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               difference between a red M&amp;M and a light brown M&amp;M. Two totally
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               different things when you're seven years old. "Well, your red 
               is
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               more of a main course M&amp;M, but the brown is more of a mellower
<b> 
</b><b>               
</b><b>               
</b>               flavour; it's an after dinner M&amp;M, really".
